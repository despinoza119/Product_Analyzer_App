well everyone let's go and take a look at the iPhone 15 and compare it against the Samsung Galaxy s22 and see how both of these phones kind of compare to one another now the s22 is last year's Flagship from Samsung the iPhone 15 is this year's kind of Flagship kind of mid phone from Apple so I'm going to be very curious to see how both these phones kind of compare now if you want to pick up either one of these devices links will be down in the description you can get them from there and you can UPS support the channel at the same time now side by side you can definitely tell there are some key differences between both of them the Samsung Galaxy s22 on the front had a 6.1 in Dynamic mlet display now this panel I think was pretty good there wasn't like a lot to complain about with this particular phone and I still feel like this device looks and feels pretty good there's not again a lot to complain about it's fairly what you'd expect it's a very good panel whole punch display 120 HZ which is very nice a like not even that much Bezel around it like it's a very goodlooking phone and it's easily one of the best characteristics going for this particular device now with the iPhone 15 on the other hand and this particular phone has a 6.1 in super red xra OLED display now there's a few different things going on with this particular phone so for one you basically have that big panel which is super nice I love having this type of display and it looks very very good but the big thing with this particular phone as far as I can tell is that one it's 60 HZ so now 120 HZ like the Galaxy s22 you're getting that Dynamic Island which again is you know good and everything but it is a bigger hole punch display than the Galaxy s22 I feel like also you're getting a little bit more bezel around this phone but this phone still feels very good it still looks very good it has a very nice display but I think the Galaxy s22 from last year definitely has a better display when it comes down to it now from the rest of the panel as you can see I definitely do think again that the iPhone 15 looks very good you know it's a very good looking panel the s22 has the you know kind of curved kind of flat side to it it's a reflective material though the iPhone 15 has a complete flat side to it I kind of do feel like the s22 feels more premium but the iPhone 15 still feels feels and looks very good as well on the bottom USB type-c ports on both SIM card tra on the bottom of the Galaxy s22 which again is a very very nice feature to have and on the back side you can see we actually have frosted glass BS on both now the standard iPhones like the base model iPhones never had frosted glass backs Apple did actually end up bringing them over this specific year which is honestly a very nice touch the Pro Models had them but the standard 15s didn't or the standard 14s and Beyond in now we have them on the base 15s which is so nice to have it's a very nice feature it looks very the Galaxy s22 also has a frosted glass back which was honestly a pretty big upgrade coming from the plastic back on the Galaxy S21 so it's very cool that we have this type of capability on this particular phone as well triple camera setup dual camera setup on the 15 your wireless charging on both phones the Galaxy s22 though does have reverse wireless charging which is very very cool the iPhone 15 unfortunately does not have reverse wireless charging still kind of a cool feature on the Galaxy s22 even though the S10 had it from so many years ago they both have IP certification they both both feel very premium there really isn't a phone I think that is like demonstrably better on the outside but I would say that the Galaxy s22 even though it's over a year old as at this point still is more of a flagship I would say than something like the iPhone 15 so from that perspective alone that kind of covers it up there now in terms of the software longevity you are definitely going to be getting a longer lasting phone on the iPhone 15 no matter what happens no matter how much I make fun of Samsung phones I love Samsung phones to be honest the software on these phones just aren't really amazing they're I mean they're you know onei has gotten improvements like crazy but the software longevity still needs to be improved Google has just improv theirs Samsung has improving theirs a bit every year too but I think definitely when it comes on to both of these the iPhone 15 is definitely going to be giving you a better experience for sure in terms of software longevity and overall software updates than something like the Samsung Galaxy s22 so take it as you will but that kind of covers it up there as well now let's go do speed comparison between both these phones the iPhone 15 has an apple 16 boning chip inside of it with 6 GB of RAM but the galaxy s22 has a Snapdragon hn1 chip set inside with 8 GB of RAM so let's go see which one's a faster phone between both okay there we go all the apps are cleared out in the background so let's get into it phone calls 32 1 okay kind of the same thing camera 3 2 1 okay don't know which one was faster let's go take a photo this one was quicker but this one didn't have the night mode one on so we'll just kind of have to skip out of this one let's go and get into their Play Store 3 2 one okay the s22 is definitely faster but the Play Store is always notoriously faster than the App Store so kind of keep that in mind but it was faster for sure on the s22 scrolling out of these two I don't know what applications we have that are similar on these panels I don't know why it always flips open into that one let's go and try I don't even know what are the ones we have similar that means we'll have to get into our game launcher and open up the games this way so let's go and get into it we can try ginch and impact 321 this is a very very popular game it's very massive and I have a feeling that the iPhone 15 may actually load this one up faster but I guess we'll wait and see and you can kind of see that between both the Galaxy s22 definitely was a little bit slower and I don't know why it was this big of a difference I wasn't exacting it to be this big of a difference but definitely for sure maybe because it just loaded up or something I'm not too sure but definitely faster on the iPhone 15 for a fact let's go and try something like see what other ones we have we can try something like snake versus blocks or stack 3 2 1 and I think the s22 definitely was faster there the iPhone 15 took its time a little bit getting into the game let's see if there's big differences see if they glitch up at all and I don't really think so I think they're going to be roughly around the same hopping out of these two let's get into another one let's go and get back into game launcher let's go and try tank you 3 2 1 and the iPhone 15 was slightly slower there gameplay wise let's see if there's a big difference and again I don't really think there's going to be helping out of these two let's get into another one let's go ahead and try Temple Run two 3 2 1 and this is not that big of a game as you can see we have problems here but I definitely would probably say again I don't know maybe the iPhone 15 was slightly faster here the Galaxy s22 slightly slower and I think that's kind of what we're seeing like the iPhone 15 is just a little bit faster more times than not but the Galaxy s22 is still holding its own and for it being over a year old at this you know as of this point it's actually kind of surprising in my opinion so from that particular standpoint thumbs up to the iPhone 15 but thumbs up to the Galaxy s22 as well for holding its own now funny enough in the camera Department this is where things get a little funny I definitely do feel like personally that the Galaxy s22 is camera is probably better you're getting a triple camera setup on the outside of the Galaxy s22 the iPhone 15 has a dual camera setup you're getting 4K 60 on the front and the back of both but the Galaxy s22 does have 8K capability on the back of this particular phone which in and of itself is a very very big deal in my opinion and having that type of capability is super awesome and that's something I love seeing from my Galaxy s22 the iPhone 15 still is a very good camera but the s22 even from last year is probably a little bit better which is pretty crazy now within this particular phone I feel like this particular camera is still very good you're getting that 5x Zoom or 6X Zoom but you're getting a 30X Zoom internally which is pretty insane you're getting things like portrait mode video mode and under more you're getting a lot more options believe it or not so you can see a bunch of different things that are basically happening prom mode pro video Single take night food so many other panels which probably don't even make too much sense but it's still very nice to have with something like the iPhone 15 I feel like this is a very very good type of you know device it's a very good type of panel looks very good it's something I really like a lot and within the iPhone 15 I feel like this is a pretty killer camera it's still you know it still looks very good I think it looks very solid for what you're getting you're getting 5x Zoom here you're getting 10x Zoom kind of going in the inside which is very nice video mode cinematic mode slow mode time laps portrait mode panorama mode there's a lot of good capability here which is something I love seeing and once again that end of itself is a very cool thing I definitely would tell you though in my personal opinion things like the Galaxy s22 are probably going to be giving you better cameras overall but it's kind of funny because when you look at an iPhone 15 and you look at a Samsung Galaxy from last year the main Flagship it's pretty crazy how good of the job these older phones kind of hold up in most ways now the iPhone 15 you're getting you know really good build quality you're getting good performance probably better performance than the s22 getting USBC Port you are getting software longevity for a long period of time and that might be all that you're getting for the most part with the Samsung Galaxy s22 you're getting more Flagship features better display no not a massive hole punch better camera in my opinion reverse wireless charging SIM card Trace still there's still a lot of capability within the s22 if I were to choose one at probably be the iPhone 15 but the Galaxy s22 definitely has features that I wish the iPhone 15 had so that kind of covers it up there if you have any other thoughts or questions let me know in the comment section below hit the like button that me so much but definitely hit that
