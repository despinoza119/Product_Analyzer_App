hey what's up guys will here for GSM Arina every year we get a new vanilla iPhone and this time around you might wonder if it's worth upgrading to the freshest model the iPhone 15 of course if you went for last year's iPhone 14 instead you'd save some cash but miss out on a few new features as well is there enough of a difference to make the iPhone 15 worth getting over the 14 let's put them head-to-head and find [Music] out this year's new iPhone generation brings a few upgrades over the previous one even at the level of the base model one of the most significant is the move from lightning to USBC connectivity another major change is that the iPhone 15 has a pill-shaped cutout on the front rather than the notch cutout you get on the iPhone 14 from the backside though you'd be hard pressed to tell the two phones apart the iPhone 15 and iPhone 14 have the same size and shape there is a slight difference in that on the new model the edge of the aluminum frame is more rounded of course both phones bring the same ip68 rated ingress protection against dust and water submersion the iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 both have a 6.1 in OLED display with ceramic Shield protection and just a 60 HZ refresh rate there are a couple of major changes on the new model though the first is the pill cutout which I already mentioned and it comes with a dynamic Island functionality for extra information and shortcuts the other change is that the iPhone 15 can boost its brightness when it needs to in auto brightness mode we saw it Max outed nearly 1, 1650 nits versus a little over 800 on the iPhone 14 this could come in handy on a sunny day Outdoors other than that both phones displays perform in a similar fashion and have support for hdr10 and Dolby Vision there's another difference when it comes to these iPhone stereo speakers the older model is slightly louder you can listen and compare the audio quality quality for yourself with the provided link as you'd expect you get basically the same software experience on either phone as they both run Apple's latest IOS 17 however since the iPhone 14 is a year older its software support won't last quite as long as the iPhone 15s another difference is that since the iPhone 15 generation has USBC connectivity you can connect the new iPhones to an external display via USBC alt mode and through USBC host post mode you can connect the iPhone 15 to peripherals like a mouse keyboard or external USB storage let's talk about the chipset the iPhone 14 runs on Apple's a15 bionic which was cutting edge two generations ago in contrast the iPhone 15 has an a16 bionic which was found in last year's Pro Models while both are quite powerful the newer chipset is a bit better the a16 bionic has support for more advanced lpddr 5x RAM and is able to provide about a 15% Improvement in overall performance the iPhone 15 has a slightly larger battery than the iPhone 14 and the battery life itself is a little better too the iPhone 15 scored an overall endurance rating of 98 hours in our tests compared to 90 hours on the iPhone 14 screen on tasks saw the most Improvement when it comes to charging speed with a proper 20 W adapter we were able to charge the iPhone 14 to 60% in half an hour and the iPhone 15 charged to 58% in the same amount of time about the same but a full charge was faster on the older model it took an hour and 31 minutes versus an hour and 50 minutes on the iPhone 15 and now for the cameras the iPhone 14 has a 12 megap main Cam and a 12 megapix Ultra wide cam meanwhile the iPhone 15 brings a new 48 megapix Main cam also paired with a 12 megapixel Ultra wide When comparing photos from the main cameras you get about the same rendition from both phones with Apple's signature look but the iPhone 15's main camera produces 24 mapel photos by default and they have more fine detail than the iPhone 14's 12 megapix photos the two times digital zoomed photos from the iPhone 15 also look better than the iPhone 14s because it has a lot more resolution to work with both phones have great low light capture with their main cams but the iPhone 15 has a slight Edge photos from the ultra wide cam aren't too impressive on either phone but the contrast and colors do match those of the main camera and finally the video capture is excellent from both the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 15 you can record in up to 4K with any of the cameras with great stabilization so there you have it guys the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 15 so which is better the answer isn't so clear-cut the iPhone iPhone 15 brings a brighter display the modern looking Dynamic Island the slightly better chipset performance and battery life and more detailed photos out of the main cam meanwhile the iPhone 14 has louder speakers and more importantly the lower price another factor to consider is lightning versus USBC it's nice to have the more Universal USB standard but if you're coming from another iPhone or everyone in your family is using lightning then USBC won't have much of a benefit for you in the end the the iPhone 15 has a slight Edge when it comes to the features but if you want to save some cash the iPhone 14 won't disappoint either thanks for watching and see you on the next one
