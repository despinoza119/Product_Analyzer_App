Apple versus Samsung the ultimate battle between Tech they've been Rivals for as long as I can remember so today we're going to be putting all of their newest products head-to head to find out once and for all which is better this will be a Fair competition we will be judging based off quality performance camera quality battery life and of course the price May the best company win the tablets now I'm a bit biased as we all know based on my channel I use a lot of Apple product but I'm going to be fair and square today satisfying ability Apple wins same exact no this one was easier to pull first thing we're comparing is the iPad 10th Generation versus the Galaxy Tab S9 Fe and that name is Long Galaxy Tab F9 e srn the Galaxy Tab s9f comes in at $379 whilst the Apple iPad comes in at $449 so not too big of a difference but apple is definitely more expensive right now Moment of Truth oh my goodness this is so [Music] cool am I dumb this is why I'm Apple user I don't know what I'm is it just me or do it not open this is why you need the arrows I do need the arrows okay so here is our galaxy tab ooh this is clean not going to lie it feels really nice and this is the key difference right here this little thing right here the pen is probably going to be the reason why this went because if you were to get the apple pencil it would be an extra $100 inside the Samsung tablet we have charger and then I guess the instructions is there anything else in the Box no then over here on the iPad ooh she's nice she's pretty and then inside the Apple box we have a block and a braided charger which is sick because the other one wasn't braided okay so we're pretty even Steven right about now but let's turn them on dude I feel like it's such a I feel like such a dummy when it comes to like Samsungs cuz I really don't know how to function these things not going to lie oh see the Apple's already on it's already on and ready this one took forever oh okay all right so I'm going to go ahead and Skip through the boring part and start both of these up okay so I have both of them on and ready to go to be honest right off the B the apple is so much more colorful I know that's not even good comparison but this looks way better but this pen is so fun look watch [Music] this this pretty cool I think go first things first I'm the realest oh shoot I just looked up the battery life on both of these the iPad is a 10 hour straight and I was like wow that's really good Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 20 hours they said doubly I'm going to have to give it to Samsung Point Samsung oh and then the price Samsung wins too oh Samsung is winning so much right now this freaking crazy let's do video quality I think it's very important to test out how good the video watching looks because let's all be so for real we're all watching Sil G right now 160 dude I'm actually really liking this right now to be honest so are you going to switch to Samsung no what this is for science this is not for me this is for science time to do the video test I'm so excited well this is so freaking hard dude this is impossible I'm like oh let me just compare them it'll be so easy apple apple apple apple I don't want all the comments being like she just picked Apple because she just likes it better I'm being fair and square for video playback I'm going to have to give it to Samsung I don't know why I feel like it just looks like better coloring better quality I mean of course it's really hard to tell based off a YouTube video but just based on watching it back I think the Samsung wi now it's time to test out the performance and what better way to test out the performance of a device then you ain't ready for this one I'll give you a hint yeah not going to lie we open this at 100% or like 95% it's at 87 already iPads die fast they look so similar it's not even funny like they just both look good there's no complaints with either of these I guess they make good devices huh I can't do both at the same time impressive thank you using my multitasking skills based on performance I feel like it's just a tie there's absolutely no way we can tell performance the tablet battle based on everything the Samsung tablet wins it's overall cheaper better and it comes with the pen I feel bad betraying out next thing up we're going to try out the Galaxy buds 2 Pro versus the airpod tube there's no sticker to pull than Galaxy buds 2 Pro yeah so this is obviously not the original Apple packaging whoops but we have of course the charger and the airpods and then over here we have the Samsung 2 buds BR Galaxy buds 2 Pro the biggest way we're going to compare these is really just how good they sound and the battery both of these earbuds are priced at the exact same amount of $179 so that is a tie the airpods third generation battery life lasts 6 hours without the charging case and the Galaxy buds 2 Pro lasts 8 hours whatever so now it's time but the only thing that's actually important all right just the ear budge I like the look of the airpods better to be honest they're easier to put on too cuz they have like a little handle bro my favorite okay our little jelly beans going in these sound better these are definitely louder but these definitely I can hear like every little like beat and rum and sound from the studio that was made this masterpiece this is one of the most difficult decisions I've ever had to make after a further dilemma and debate the fact that this lasts longer in the battery and just the overall I feel like these are easier to use though like I'm not saying that these are better in every way I'm just saying that they sound better and they last longer but these are like still my favorite cuz they pair very easily and they're easier to use just based off of the fact yxy wins again bro this is rigged this is freaking rigged honestly I'm so sad like I feel like this is not right this is not how it's supposed to go the moment you guys have been waiting for the ultimate battle the iPhone 15 Pro Max and the Galaxy s24 Ultra these are both in the new titanium color the Galaxy s24 Ultra is actually starting at $1,400 versus Apple's $1,200 for the first time in history I think Samsung's actually more expensive you see that you see how unsatisfying that freaking tear was ridiculous now this is crazy this has to be the most ultimate showdown of all time look at it so the battery for video watchback for the Galaxy is 30 hours versus the iPhone which is 29 hours so again not a huge difference not a big deal I just think it's so funny that both of the companies came up with a titanium color at the same time inside the Apple box of course we have the instructions Apple stickers and the braided cable charger inside the Samsung box the charger instructions I don't think the internet is ready for this not satisfying wait just wait for it wow I tried okay wow look at that you should not be in the same room together this kind of crazy okay I feel like apple screen is obviously way better this is just being nitpicky but like I want to be welcomed with hello colors just a blank white welcome screen okay so we're into both of our smartphones the Galaxy and the iPhone and this is what we're looking like so far I have to say I'm not used to like a Galaxy Samsung feel whatsoever I think the look of both of them are super cool it looks like it would poke your eye out yeah it is pretty sharp I'm not going to lie just holding it like there's like very pointy edges and it's not like that comfortable for me to hold check this out guys yall are ready for this a pen I don't know why I love the pen so much dude it's like when I had a DS I just love that they always incorporate the pen for some reason who wouldn't want a littleit a pen right now Samsung wins just for this little thing of course now we have to test the biggest thing with the two different smartphones the cameras everything else is pretty similar but the cameras is the biggest deal to me cuz I SP the most time using the camera on my phone okay let's see ooh that's close that is close I can't tell which one looks better I think I look less crusty in the Apple One M Samsung's is definitely more like contrast and like more sharp this is the camera test on both of the phones what are we thinking which one looks better right now apple looks like it's winning dang you guys are going to have to comment down below which one you think looks better because I really can't tell like I feel like both of them look great just in different ways I have no idea I think we're going to have to take this camera test up a level and go outside all right oh my gosh this is crazy I think we have a obvious winner right now after just looking at this footage I think the Samsung is having a really hard time picking up all this Apple's looking way crispier right now I can't tell time to see the final verdict on the camera oh man this is tough it's so close they look so similar it's honestly crazy I feel like each of them do better under certain lightings dude I think Apple wins am I biased apples just always been better at cameras though that's just how it is that's how it be no that's crazy that's hard to tell right look better though you think so yeah okay Samsung I don't know I feel like it has to put Apple just cuz I think so huh bro they're just like coping each other at this point although look at when you turn on the Galaxy that one's kind of cooler and of course we have to test out the speakers to see which one has a better overall sound I'm not super professional with all of this so don't go hate on me in the comments being like oh my God she doesn't even know what she's talking about I'm just judging based on my own personal opinion okay so calm down of course our favorite non-copyright sounds dude they sound the exact same the overall feel of this one my hand though is kind of annoying this one's way easier to hold I do feel that the screen is bigger than this one just because it's a square overall these are very very close devices they're both really really awesome both really really expensive based on the overall price battery for performance and quality the winner of the smartphone Awards in the sah Grace book of world record it is an official book the iPhone 15 Pro Max now you can argue with me on the comments I get it Samsung has its very own perks and benefits but overall just the user friendliness of the iPhone and the camera most importantly which is the most important thing to me iPhone wins it and for the price you're charging us $200 extra for the pen next up is the watch category we have the Galaxy watch 6 versus the Apple watch 9 45 mm so this is the newest watch of each starting off with the price the Galaxy watch 6 comes in at $339 while the Apple watch comes in at $399 so it's about $50 more expensive which is not too shabby I obviously am an Apple watch user so I'm going to try my best not to be biased packaging let's just be so for real Apple wins every time like come on now come on come on that's an experience this is like Oh yay I got my new my new Samsung watch this is Magic I feel like apple is just like when you open their products it's just an experience like everybody knows it like when you get a new Apple product you peel it open for the first time it's just like so here is the new Apple watch series 9 I have not even seen this before so I'm excited and then we have the Apple watch band all right so here are the two watches I don't really know how to turn this one on dude both of these suck so far neither of them have battery okay so both of them popped up pretty quickly let's go ahead and set them up personally I like the Galaxy look better just because it looks more like your classic watch and doesn't look super like it doesn't stand out as much as the Apple watch does see look how much quicker that was your Apple watch is paired why does it need to download a software call me impatient if you want but I'm impatient honestly this is going to be the TA tail sign whichever one Finish First wins the Samsung actually beat the Apple so the watch is now paired I feel like this is going to have to be one of the hardest comparisons because how the heck do you compare a watch like I feel like it's definitely personal preference on like what style you like better okay so now that I have the watch on this thing is actually huge I don't know if I'm meant to get the screen this big or if they even make smaller ones but it does look a little silly goofy yo it's a little laggy daily activity run walking cycling basic stuff sleep tracker body composition what the heck or fat I know it's going to tell me if I'm I have no idea how accurate this this thing is 36% body fat there are legit whole machine don't put my body fat percentage on there it's embarrassing body get this off you're not fat bad I swear to you there are like whole machines for this kind of stuff there's absolutely no way a watch could do that sleep weather calendar okay what is this Samsung be so freaking for real what is this what is this that looks like it's going to haunt me in my dream terrifying I look like I got run over my four C it's been a long day bro Samsung just called me fat and ugly in so many different ways oh well it does kind of look like me no ah samung you have questionable tastes you have questionable tastes to say the least okay so this is what the Apple watch looks like and personally I like this layout better cuz I'm familiar with it but it also is just more bright and colorful but this one doesn't have a freaking body composition like that other one that was cool they all have pretty much the same thing which is like the ability to text from it call from it I know I may be a little biased but I do think that the Apple watch faces are way better they're just like cleaner and more like modern I mean look we got mickeey Mouse right here come on now I think these are just cool cuz they have all this information on the screen more practical exactly they're practical they're boring honestly this has to be one of the hardest comparison we did today just because they're so similar they do relatively the same thing and the prices were so similar honestly I feel like this comparison is based personally on just personal opinion and preference that's my opinion for this one going to have to go to the abat and after going through every single device and dividing up points for whichever win the win of the Apple versus Samsung competition with the Samsung tablet winning that's one point Samsung the Galaxy Budz is another point for Samsung the smartphone is a win for apple and the watches is a win for Apple so the grand total of who has a better ecosystem is a tie I guess we'll just have to leave it up to the comment section
