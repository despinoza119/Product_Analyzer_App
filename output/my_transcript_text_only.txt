well everyone it's time for us to go and take a look at the Google pixel Watch 2 and compare it against the Apple Watch series 9 and see which particular watch is the better one for you now there are lots and lots of advantages and disadvantages between both of these devices but I will tell you that there isn't really one that's the better one between both the biggest thing I've always told people is that if you want to go ahead and basically get a you know watch for your Android phone you kind of have to go with the Google pixel watch or a Samsung Galaxy watch or one of those if you have an iPhone really the only option you have is a you know Apple watch so keep that in mind if you want to pick up either one of these devices though links will be down in the description you can get them from there and you can UPS support the channel at the same time now starting off with the outside of both these watches the Apple Watch series 9 is a really good watch you know I love this watch a lot on the outside of this watch you're getting it in basically two different specifications you're getting it either in the 41 mm size or the 45 mm size Within These so that's just one of those things to keep in mind here if you're somebody who wanted to go and buy you know a watch for your iPhone like I mentioned this is one of the options and the size of this watch is very good I've always loved it it you know it's not a perfect watch by any means but it is a different design than the Google pixel watch which only comes out in one size it only comes in that 41 mm size I am okay with it like I think it's good and everything but I do wish we kind of had a bigger size or at least two different options we can choose from whether it was like the 40 and 44 or 41 and 45 I wish there was another option out there where we could go ahead and basically you know have that Improvement there I do think in the future you know Google's probably going to do this I'm surprised they still haven't done this yet but that's just one of those things to kind of keep in mind here from that perspective as well now the design is also different it's a circular design on the pixel Watch 2 that's like another small thing to kind of keep in mind you're getting one button on the side which allows you to just click on it on the pixel Watch 2 on the Apple watch you're getting two buttons the digital crown and that side button very cool stuff you know they kind of do the exact same thing but it's still nice to have that type of feature set on the back side we basically have a wireless charging pad so what we can do is we can go ahead and plug this thing straight into into a wireless charger and we can go and charge up this specific you know pixel watch just like that which is honestly very very cool so once again having the capability of just charging up your watch is super awesome and that's something once again that I look at and I'm a big massive fan of as well so from that specific standpoint I will tell you from the outside both these watches hold up very very well there's not really a lot to complain about from that specific perspective and I will tell you from that you know standpoint both these hold up very very well from there which is super super cool now on top of that I will tell you when it comes down to the rest of these bodies like I said I don't think there's one that I'm like oh my goodness this is the one that you have to pick up or anything like that but they're both very solid I will tell you the band structure between both is something that's super cool I love having those types of bands that are kind of interchangeable in a way and with these ones they hold up very very well which I'm really really happy about so once again from that perspective gets a thumbs up for me as well now from this type of watch another big thing to keep in mind is the pricing the pixel Watch 2 is $350 the Apple Watch series 9 basically starts at $3.99 now the cell models and everything kind of change in price for the Apple watches but there's about a $50 difference between the two between the two bottom tier models again again just kind of depends on which one you want now when it comes down to the features inside I don't really know if there's one particular watch that I would look at as it having the most amount of features between these two I feel like both these are within their own realm like they're kind of in their own worlds because Android iOS you know they kind of have their own features but at their core they do almost the exact same type of things so if you're wanting to go ahead and get a watch like I said these two watches are going to beic be doing the exact same thing between them which again is super cool if you're wanted to go ahead and have your high and low heart rate notifications if you want the ECG apps if you want the you know all this other stuff you can do it I will say with the pixel watch it does look like you do have that interesting thing which is basically the skin temperature sensing and a lot more stress focused sensing which is really cool I don't know I don't think the Apple watch has stuff like that it kind of does it a little bit but that is something that's kind of interesting resting on the pixel watch but beyond that from what I would do on an everyday basis between my watches these two watches basically be able to handle everything I would be able to do because most of the time what I'm doing like I mentioned before I'm just basically checking my notifications and very rarely am I ever doing anything else maybe I'm tracking a workout here and there or maybe I'm doing something else like that but the majority of the time and the majority of things that I'm doing it's usually very very basic stuff so what I would tell you is with both these watches they are very solid options I like these watches a lot but I will probably tell you if if you're wanting to go ahead and buy the better watch for you it really comes down to are you on Android or iOS if you're on Android go for the pixel watch if you're on iPhone or iOS go for the Apple watch and that's kind of the best way I can kind of describe it so that pretty much covers it up there if you have any other thoughts or questions let me know in the comment section below hit the like button that me so much but definitely
