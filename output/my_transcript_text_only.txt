this video is really geared towards iPhone 11 and earlier individuals if you're rocking one of those devices you're probably looking at the iPhone 15 as your next upgrade if you're rocking an iPhone 12 and I said this in my last video it really depends on your battery is the battery pretty poor you find the phone to slow down a bit if that's the case then the iPhone 15 is a good update candidate if you're rocking an iPhone 13 or 14 I'd probably wait another couple of years now this is a incremental update like it has been over the past few years but I think this year is a bit more significant since they changed a few things but you know at the same time it's your same iPhone you know last year's iPhone 14 colors were very bright and bold like you have this very bright red this year on the iPhone 15 and 15 plus the colors are a bit more muted now this really comes down to your personal preference I like this it looks minimalistic it looks super clean but others might feel like they like last year's colors better the benefit of using this type of color is that they could Frost the back glass which means you don't say fingerprints I've been touching all these devices on the back equally and as you can see here the fingerprints on last year's iPhone 14 are much more substantial right off the bat when you pick up an iPhone 14 and a 15 in your hand you'll notice how it feels on the 14 the edges were a bit squared off they were slightly sharper not as sharp as the 14 pro or Pro Max but you know it felt like a box of your phone this year's iPhone 15 they rounded them off like it just feels super comfortable to hold this is good news for those of you out there who plan to rock their phone without a case it's just gonna be a little bit nicer in terms of how it feels now it could be my mind playing tricks on me but it does feel like the buttons on the new iPhone 15 are a bit clickier maybe it's because the edges are a bit rougher compared to the smoother ones on last year's model but they definitely feel nicer to click there is a difference in weight it's ever so slightly lighter like a gram you're not going to feel it like you would with the pro Max in the Pro Max 14 from last year but yes it's technically lighter overall but it's the same storage options starting at 128 gigabytes and you have the same size screen at 6.12 inches but the big deal this year is that you have a completely different looking Notch they are incorporating the dynamic Island from last year's iPhone 14 pro and they've placed it on the iPhone 15. now quite frankly it's not a must-have feature but I do think it's clever because it takes something that doesn't look the best and actually gives it a use case and you know more manufacturers are adding capabilities to it like if you use Uber or if you use doordash it will use the dynamic Notch to play some of its activity which is kind of handy because you know you could be looking at something else and then you stare up at your Dynamic Island and then you'll see you know some information that could be important to you the camera on the front is still 12 megapixels I don't think much has changed there but you guys watch this video and let me know if you see any differences so right now you're looking at the front facing cameras of the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 15 they should be pretty much identical but you guys let me know how the microphones sound and if you notice any visual differences but what is different is the port on the bottom of the phone I know you guys know already that this is now rocking USBC it's a bit different than the USBC that's on the Pro Models those have a transfer speed of 10 gigabits per second and Apple's allowing you to do a lot more with it like connect external drives monitors microphones you name it it will probably work with that type c Port but with the iPhone 15 you're very limited the speeds are identical to lightning you're only getting 480 megabits per second so it's not the fastest transfer rate which I imagine most people buying an iPhone 15 anyways probably won't need that often and you can't connect devices to it the only thing you can do now is reverse charge so if I have a pair of airpods I can connect a USB type-c cable from the phone to the airpods and they will charge if I have a type c to lightning cable I can charge last year's iPhone 14 and of course everybody who's rocking an Android device you can charge their phone as well now if you're charging two iPhones at the exact same time two iPhone 15s basically what happens is the iPhone 15 with the least amount of charge will be the one that starts charging first there's still two speakers on the phone for stereo sound I don't see a big difference in terms of sound quality and it could be my ears playing tricks on me but the new iPhone 15 sounds a little bit brighter whereas the old iPhone 14 has a little bit more low end if that makes any sense but overall there's not much of a difference [Music] thank you [Applause] the display is interesting because you still have that OLED panel and yes I know it's 60 hertz still and look we can take this in two ways as an Enthusiast as someone who's like a hardcore nerd when it comes to this stuff I couldn't do it I can't do 60 hertz on a phone anymore I'm way past that but if you look at the market data if you look at everything for instance on what apple is selling most people just don't know what a high refresh rate is most people don't know what 120 hertz is most people don't simply care and this is just one way for Apple to differentiate their iPhone 15 from their obviously Pro lineup eventually one day all these displays will have a higher refresh rate but until their consumers actually care there's not really much of a reason for Apple to care to put a high refresh display on either of these phones now you could make the argument is that the customers deserve more right even if they don't understand what's going on and I get it I get where you're coming from but I don't know I don't think it matters for most people but for me personally I have to have a high refresh rate now they did change the display driver on the new iPhone 15 so it's supposed to be a bit more efficient which should translate into slightly better battery life and look the battery life on these phones have been really good like I was easily to able to get through the entire day without any issues like I've been using these phones very very heavily and it easily lasts through the entire day but here's the thing you got the plus over here so if you want like insane battery life go for the Plus instead because you get the bigger display and the bigger battery but everything else remains equal so that's the only benefit for going for the plus it's just bigger display bigger battery but you do have to spend another hundred dollars now the iPhone 15 does not get the new action button that's specifically reserved for the Pro Models but my guess is maybe next year it will trickle down to the iPhone 16. it's still a mute switch which I feel like is fine for most people but you know if you want that action button you do have to pay more I will say that the performance on the new iPhone 15 is noticeable it's the same processor that was inside last year's iPhone 14 pro which is the a16 and I didn't really notice that much of a difference in everyday use I didn't really notice that much of a difference in terms of gaming but the one area where I did notice a difference was actual photography like if you are taking photos at night or anything that requires heavy processing the a16 made a difference I didn't have to wait as long for the picture to be taken which I found very weird on the iPhone 14 where it just took a little bit longer but look regardless of whether you go for 15 or 14 these processes are still at the top of their game like they're still so fast you know like the a15 that's inside the 14 model may not be the fastest chip this year in terms of what Android offers but it's right up there and this a16 is still faster than anything that you know Qualcomm or mediatek has released so I feel like these phones are doing such a good job of future proofing themselves in terms of actual performance now the camera situation is very interesting because it is using a 48 megapixel camera which is the same size as the iPhone 14 pro last year but I don't think it's the same 48 megapixel Hardware because I was looking at the aperture and this new one is using F1 1.7 whereas last year's model was F 1.8 either way I'm not seeing a big difference between this new iPhone 15 and iPhone 14 in terms of overall quality like don't get me wrong it's now taking photos at 24 megapixels instead of 12 which means when I zoom in a little bit it seems to be a slightly bit sharper you just get a cleaner picture overall and sometimes it will produce a bit more contrast but don't get me wrong like there are times where this iPhone 14 has slightly more dynamic range but the differences are nothing major like I feel like if you were to use the same camera from last year and had it in the same phone you probably wouldn't be that upset because they produce such similar results the good news though is that when you are taking photos with the iPhone 15 they take it faster like any sort of major processing happens faster on this phone because the A7 or a16 rather is a faster chip overall and when you're talking nighttime photography the same things translate over to there sometimes I'd actually get a bit more dynamic range with the iPhone 14 but I found those shots were taken faster with the iPhone 15 and obviously things tended to be a bit sharper because there was more information to work with now if you're planning on buying an iPhone 15 you're gonna like the new portrait effect it allows you to take a regular photo then turn it into a portrait later which is kind of great because sometimes I'll take a photo and I'm like oh man you know I kind of wish I blurred out the background but you can do that in post all you got to do is go into your photos choose one so this is one of me and my son hit portrait on the bottom left and then I can change the depth of the background and automatically blurs me and everything behind my son and puts him directly in Focus now you can do this with portrait as well so let's say you took a portrait shot for example and you know you wanted to unblur the background all you have to do is basically go back into that photo hit edit again and since this is a portrait shot already you can go ahead and adjust the depth to bring bring the background into the foreground so you can see everything instead now the cool thing about the 15 Pro and the 15 Pro Max those allow you to properly blur the foreground and open up the background so you have a little bit more of control now unfortunately you don't get prores or prores raw with the iPhone 15 but I feel like most users buying this phone probably don't care about that but you know you can shoot 4K 60. I did shoot a couple of 4K 30 Films it again looks identical to the iPhone 14. I'm not seeing a big difference but is it me or does the iPhone 14 have slightly better image stabilization even when I used quick action or action mode rather the video looked a little bit smoother on the iPhone 14 from last year now the big update with this new 48 megapixel sensor is that you get a lot less lens flare and one of the comments I heard in my previous video was that some of you actually liked it because it added some creativity to the video you were taking and depending on what your doing it absolutely can but if you look at this video here you can see that the lens flare on the iPhone 14 is completely obstructing what you can see in the video now in terms of heat management it does get a little bit hot if you're using this for a long period of time especially if you're gaming a lot so it will throttle but you know I didn't really feel the effect no games dropped any frames everything was nice and smooth and I feel like this is just you know what you get when you buy an iPhone so here's the thing I like the iPhone 15. I know it doesn't have everything we want in terms of like a higher refresh rate and all that kind of stuff but I feel like for those of you out there who just want a solid phone a good phone an iPhone the iPhone 15 really checks those boxes now it's a phone that costs 799 dollars and I think you know if you're looking at this and you want better battery life and a bigger screen I feel like the plus model is actually worth a hundred dollars more whereas last year I might have said you know just pay the extra and get the pro Max instead but because the pro Max is a couple hundred dollars more expense as of this year compared to last year because they got rid of the base storage I feel like the plus makes a lot more sense if you just want that bigger display again not an upgrade if you have a 13 or 14 this is a fantastic upgrade if you're coming from an iPhone 11 and earlier if you're rocking the 12 if you're happy with your experience right now and your battery seems to be okay maybe you wait another year either way I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did feel free to hit the like button if you're new to the channel subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next one
