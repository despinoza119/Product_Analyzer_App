0:00,well everyone let's go and take a look
0:01,at the iPhone 15 and compare it against
0:03,the Samsung Galaxy s22 and see how both
0:06,of these phones kind of compare to one
0:07,another now the s22 is last year's
0:10,Flagship from Samsung the iPhone 15 is
0:12,this year's kind of Flagship kind of mid
0:14,phone from Apple so I'm going to be very
0:17,curious to see how both these phones
0:18,kind of compare now if you want to pick
0:19,up either one of these devices links
0:21,will be down in the description you can
0:23,get them from there and you can UPS
0:24,support the channel at the same time now
0:26,side by side you can definitely tell
0:27,there are some key differences between
0:29,both of them the Samsung Galaxy s22 on
0:31,the front had a 6.1 in Dynamic mlet
0:34,display now this panel I think was
0:36,pretty good there wasn't like a lot to
0:38,complain about with this particular
0:39,phone and I still feel like this device
0:42,looks and feels pretty good there's not
0:44,again a lot to complain about it's
0:46,fairly what you'd expect it's a very
0:47,good panel whole punch display 120 HZ
0:50,which is very nice a like not even that
0:52,much Bezel around it like it's a very
0:54,goodlooking phone and it's easily one of
0:56,the best characteristics going for this
0:57,particular device now with the iPhone 15
1:00,on the other hand and this particular
1:02,phone has a 6.1 in super red xra OLED
1:05,display now there's a few different
1:07,things going on with this particular
1:08,phone so for one you basically have that
1:11,big panel which is super nice I love
1:12,having this type of display and it looks
1:14,very very good but the big thing with
1:16,this particular phone as far as I can
1:18,tell is that one it's 60 HZ so now 120
1:21,HZ like the Galaxy s22 you're getting
1:23,that Dynamic Island which again is you
1:25,know good and everything but it is a
1:26,bigger hole punch display than the
1:28,Galaxy s22
1:30,I feel like also you're getting a little
1:31,bit more bezel around this phone but
1:33,this phone still feels very good it
1:34,still looks very good it has a very nice
1:35,display but I think the Galaxy s22 from
1:38,last year definitely has a better
1:39,display when it comes down to it now
1:41,from the rest of the panel as you can
1:42,see I definitely do think again that the
1:44,iPhone 15 looks very good you know it's
1:46,a very good looking panel the s22 has
1:49,the you know kind of curved kind of flat
1:51,side to it it's a reflective material
1:53,though the iPhone 15 has a complete flat
1:55,side to it I kind of do feel like the
1:56,s22 feels more premium but the iPhone 15
1:59,still feels feels and looks very good as
2:00,well on the bottom USB type-c ports on
2:03,both SIM card tra on the bottom of the
2:05,Galaxy s22 which again is a very very
2:07,nice feature to have and on the back
2:09,side you can see we actually have
2:10,frosted glass BS on both now the
2:13,standard iPhones like the base model
2:14,iPhones never had frosted glass backs
2:16,Apple did actually end up bringing them
2:17,over this specific year which is
2:19,honestly a very nice touch the Pro
2:21,Models had them but the standard 15s
2:22,didn't or the standard 14s and Beyond in
2:25,now we have them on the base 15s which
2:26,is so nice to have it's a very nice
2:28,feature it looks very
2:30,the Galaxy s22 also has a frosted glass
2:32,back which was honestly a pretty big
2:34,upgrade coming from the plastic back on
2:35,the Galaxy S21 so it's very cool that we
2:37,have this type of capability on this
2:39,particular phone as well triple camera
2:41,setup dual camera setup on the 15 your
2:43,wireless charging on both phones the
2:45,Galaxy s22 though does have reverse
2:47,wireless charging which is very very
2:49,cool the iPhone 15 unfortunately does
2:51,not have reverse wireless charging still
2:53,kind of a cool feature on the Galaxy s22
2:55,even though the S10 had it from so many
2:56,years ago they both have IP
2:58,certification they both both feel very
3:00,premium there really isn't a phone I
3:01,think that is like demonstrably better
3:04,on the outside but I would say that the
3:05,Galaxy s22 even though it's over a year
3:08,old as at this point still is more of a
3:10,flagship I would say than something like
3:12,the iPhone 15 so from that perspective
3:15,alone that kind of covers it up there
3:17,now in terms of the software longevity
3:20,you are definitely going to be getting a
3:21,longer lasting phone on the iPhone 15 no
3:24,matter what happens no matter how much I
3:25,make fun of Samsung phones I love
3:26,Samsung phones to be honest the software
3:28,on these phones just aren't really
3:30,amazing they're I mean they're you know
3:32,onei has gotten improvements like crazy
3:34,but the software longevity still needs
3:36,to be improved Google has just improv
3:38,theirs Samsung has improving theirs a
3:40,bit every year too but I think
3:41,definitely when it comes on to both of
3:43,these the iPhone 15 is definitely going
3:45,to be giving you a better experience for
3:47,sure in terms of software longevity and
3:48,overall software updates than something
3:50,like the Samsung Galaxy s22 so take it
3:53,as you will but that kind of covers it
3:54,up there as well now let's go do speed
3:56,comparison between both these phones the
3:58,iPhone 15 has an apple 16 boning chip
4:00,inside of it with 6 GB of RAM but the
4:03,galaxy s22 has a Snapdragon hn1 chip set
4:06,inside with 8 GB of RAM so let's go see
4:08,which one's a faster phone between both
4:10,okay there we go all the apps are
4:12,cleared out in the background so let's
4:14,get into it phone calls 32 1 okay kind
4:17,of the same thing camera 3 2
4:22,1 okay don't know which one was faster
4:24,let's go take a
4:25,photo this one was quicker but this one
4:27,didn't have the night mode one on so
4:28,we'll just kind of have to skip out of
4:29,this one let's go and get into their
4:31,Play Store 3 2
4:32,one okay the s22 is definitely faster
4:36,but the Play Store is always notoriously
4:37,faster than the App Store so kind of
4:39,keep that in mind but it was faster for
4:40,sure on the s22 scrolling out of these
4:42,two I don't know what applications we
4:43,have that are similar on these panels I
4:46,don't know why it always flips open into
4:47,that one let's go and try I don't even
4:49,know what are the ones we have similar
4:50,that means we'll have to get into our
4:52,game launcher and open up the games this
4:53,way so let's go and get into it we can
4:56,try ginch and impact 321 this is a very
4:59,very popular game it's very massive and
5:01,I have a feeling that the iPhone 15 may
5:03,actually load this one up faster but I
5:04,guess we'll wait and see and you can
5:07,kind of see that between both the Galaxy
5:10,s22 definitely was a little bit slower
5:13,and I don't know why it was this big of
5:14,a difference I wasn't exacting it to be
5:15,this big of a difference but definitely
5:17,for sure maybe because it just loaded up
5:19,or something I'm not too sure but
5:20,definitely faster on the iPhone 15 for a
5:22,fact let's go and try something like see
5:24,what other ones we have we can try
5:26,something like snake versus blocks or
5:28,stack 3 2 1
5:32,and I think the s22 definitely was
5:34,faster there the iPhone 15 took its time
5:37,a little bit getting into the game let's
5:39,see if there's big differences see if
5:40,they glitch up at all and I don't really
5:43,think so I think they're going to be
5:44,roughly around the same hopping out of
5:45,these two let's get into another one
5:47,let's go and get back into game launcher
5:48,let's go and try tank you 3 2
5:53,1 and the iPhone 15 was slightly slower
5:57,there gameplay wise let's see if there's
5:59,a big difference and again I don't
6:00,really think there's going to be helping
6:01,out of these two let's get into another
6:03,one let's go ahead and try Temple Run
6:05,two 3 2
6:11,1 and this is not that big of a game as
6:14,you can see we have problems here but I
6:16,definitely would probably say again I
6:19,don't know maybe the iPhone 15
6:21,was slightly faster here the Galaxy s22
6:24,slightly slower and I think that's kind
6:26,of what we're seeing like the iPhone 15
6:27,is just a little bit faster more times
6:28,than not but the Galaxy s22 is still
6:31,holding its own and for it being over a
6:32,year old at this you know as of this
6:34,point it's actually kind of surprising
6:35,in my opinion so from that particular
6:37,standpoint thumbs up to the iPhone 15
6:39,but thumbs up to the Galaxy s22 as well
6:41,for holding its own now funny enough in
6:43,the camera Department this is where
6:45,things get a little funny I definitely
6:47,do feel like personally that the Galaxy
6:48,s22 is camera is probably better you're
6:50,getting a triple camera setup on the
6:51,outside of the Galaxy s22 the iPhone 15
6:54,has a dual camera setup you're getting
6:56,4K 60 on the front and the back of both
6:58,but the Galaxy s22 does have 8K
7:00,capability on the back of this
7:01,particular phone which in and of itself
7:03,is a very very big deal in my opinion
7:05,and having that type of capability is
7:06,super awesome and that's something I
7:08,love seeing from my Galaxy s22 the
7:10,iPhone 15 still is a very good camera
7:12,but the s22 even from last year is
7:14,probably a little bit better which is
7:16,pretty crazy now within this particular
7:18,phone I feel like this particular camera
7:20,is still very good you're getting that
7:22,5x Zoom or 6X Zoom but you're getting a
7:25,30X Zoom internally which is pretty
7:27,insane you're getting things like
7:29,portrait mode video mode and under more
7:31,you're getting a lot more options
7:33,believe it or not so you can see a bunch
7:35,of different things that are basically
7:36,happening prom mode pro video Single
7:38,take night food so many other panels
7:41,which probably don't even make too much
7:42,sense but it's still very nice to have
7:44,with something like the iPhone 15 I feel
7:45,like this is a very very good type of
7:48,you know device it's a very good type of
7:50,panel looks very good it's something I
7:51,really like a lot and within the iPhone
7:53,15 I feel like this is a pretty killer
7:55,camera it's still you know it still
7:56,looks very good I think it looks very
7:58,solid for what you're getting you're
7:59,getting 5x Zoom here you're getting 10x
8:02,Zoom kind of going in the inside which
8:04,is very nice video mode cinematic mode
8:06,slow mode time laps portrait mode
8:08,panorama mode there's a lot of good
8:10,capability here which is something I
8:11,love seeing and once again that end of
8:13,itself is a very cool thing I definitely
8:16,would tell you though in my personal
8:17,opinion things like the Galaxy s22 are
8:19,probably going to be giving you better
8:20,cameras overall but it's kind of funny
8:22,because when you look at an iPhone 15
8:24,and you look at a Samsung Galaxy from
8:25,last year the main Flagship it's pretty
8:27,crazy how good of the job these older
8:29,phones kind of hold up in most ways now
8:31,the iPhone 15 you're getting you know
8:32,really good build quality you're getting
8:34,good performance probably better
8:35,performance than the s22 getting USBC
8:38,Port you are getting software longevity
8:40,for a long period of time and that might
8:43,be all that you're getting for the most
8:44,part with the Samsung Galaxy s22 you're
8:47,getting more Flagship features better
8:48,display no not a massive hole punch
8:51,better camera in my opinion reverse
8:53,wireless charging SIM card Trace still
8:55,there's still a lot of capability within
8:57,the s22 if I were to choose one at
8:59,probably be the iPhone 15 but the Galaxy
9:01,s22 definitely has features that I wish
9:03,the iPhone 15 had so that kind of covers
9:06,it up there if you have any other
9:08,thoughts or questions let me know in the
9:09,comment section below hit the like
9:11,button that me so much but definitely
9:12,hit that subscribe button more
9:13,importantly than everything else I love

9:16,catch you guys in the next video peace
