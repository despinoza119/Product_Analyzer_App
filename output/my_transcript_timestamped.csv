0:00,when I first looked at the new iPhone 15
0:02,I was a little surprised just how much
0:03,transferred over from the iPhone 14 pro
0:06,including the new design and the
0:07,excellent 48 megapixel camera sensor and
0:10,also there were some pleasant new
0:11,changes that were made to this phone
0:13,that really did make it feel like a new
0:15,iPhone and not just a dumb down iPhone
0:17,14 pro and that kind of led me to a
0:20,question because I had such a great
0:22,experience with this iPhone 15 it kind
0:24,of made me wonder did I overpay for my
0:27,iPhone 15 Pro because both of these
0:30,phones are really really good but going
0:32,into 2024 it might surprise you to know
0:35,that there's actually more key
0:36,differences now than when this phone
0:39,first launched so I wanted to take a
0:40,look at the iPhone 15 versus the iPhone
0:43,15 Pro in 2024 and let you know which
0:46,one should you get and are there any
0:48,musthave features really on this pro
0:51,model that might make me upset uh using
0:54,a regular 15 model well one thing I'm
0:57,not upset with is that both the iPhone
0:59,15 and 15 Pro use USBC but what I am
1:02,upset with is that Apple doesn't include
1:03,a charger in the box and even when they
1:05,do their Chargers are kind of lackluster
1:08,thankfully our friends at ug green sent
1:10,over their new lineup of nexo chargers
1:12,and look at how small ug Green's nexo
1:15,Pro Mini is it fits in the palm of my
1:17,hands but don't let this small size fool
1:19,you this thing is packing power it has
1:22,65 Watts with u greens Gan Infinity
1:25,technology and it can charge an M2
1:27,MacBook Air from 0% to 51% in just 30
1:31,minutes I also love this flatter design
1:33,which is ug Green's nexo Pro cookie it
1:35,features the same ports and the same
1:36,wattage as the mini but with a super
1:39,flat design that can slip into your
1:40,pocket on the go and presses up flat
1:43,against a wall outlet and this thing is
1:45,just crazy thin even ug Green's nexo Pro
1:48,100 W charger is smaller than Apple's 97
1:51,wat power brick and it features more
1:54,ports on it as well even ug Green's
1:56,Powerhouse 160 W nexe pro charger is
1:59,still smaller than the 97 wat Apple
2:02,charger and it features four ports that
2:04,can fast charge my 16-in MacBook Pro
2:06,from 0% to 50% in just 27 minutes and it
2:10,can charge my MacBook Pro two phones and
2:13,my steam deck all with one charger to
2:16,pick up one of these small but powerful
2:18,Chargers click the link in the
2:20,description below and thank you to ug
2:22,green for sponsoring this video now one
2:24,thing Apple got absolutely right with
2:25,this phone is the design it looks
2:27,exactly like the iPhone 14 pro and that
2:29,pretty much looks exactly the same as
2:31,the iPhone 15 Pro and in some ways this
2:35,actually has better design elements that
2:37,actually make me envious when I'm using
2:38,my 15 Pro first of all colors I know
2:41,Apple gets a lot of flack for the color
2:42,choices on this year's lineup and yeah a
2:44,lot of these colors are kind of
2:46,desaturated but the color infused glass
2:48,on the iPhone 15 lineup looks a lot more
2:51,vibrant and playful than the Shades of
2:53,Gray you get on the 15 Pro it may not
2:55,show off well in videos or pictures but
2:57,pick this thing up at the Apple Store
2:58,view the phone at all different angles
3:01,just pay attention to that color infused
3:03,glass which is a new design element on
3:05,the iPhone 15 and you will really
3:08,appreciate just how sleek and clean this
3:11,design looks I'm also so glad the glossy
3:14,glass backs are gone on the regular
3:18,iPhone models the MATC glass Feel So
3:20,Soft to the touch so good in the hands
3:23,and I'm just so happy that's on the
3:24,regular models now and despite Apple
3:27,using Titanium on the 15 Pro to get
3:29,these phone lower in weight after all
3:32,that advanced engineering the iPhone 15
3:34,and 15 plus are still lighter than the
3:36,pro phones and I consider that a huge
3:38,plus death to heavy phones and all that
3:41,right I also don't miss out on many of
3:43,the other design features that the 15
3:45,pro has the regular 15 has the most
3:47,important Design Elements now like the
3:48,dynamic Island which I use all the time
3:51,for playing and pausing music or viewing
3:53,updates on my flight status and stalking
3:55,my Uber Eats driver as they slowly creep
3:57,up to my house with my order of Chipotle
4:00,a double chicken burrito bowl white rice
4:02,black beans fajita veggies no cheese
4:05,salsa salsa ver try it
4:10,out I'm hungry the displays are
4:13,also exactly the same OLED panels with
4:16,the same brightness ratings and both
4:18,look fantastic the one big downside for
4:20,the regular 15 is that it is lacking the
4:23,120 HZ promotion refresh rate and while
4:26,this may be a big deal for a lot of
4:27,former pro iPhone users and Android
4:29,users I think the vast majority of
4:32,iPhone users simply don't care or simply
4:35,don't even notice that there is a faster
4:37,refresh rate on the 15 Pro call me an
4:40,idiot all you want attack my tech
4:42,credentials in the comments below but if
4:44,you give me an iPhone 15 Pro I obviously
4:47,noticed the faster refresh rate I'm not
4:49,saying it isn't there it clearly is and
4:51,yeah I do like having the faster 120 HZ
4:54,refresh rate but the brain it's a weird
4:58,thing because after a week of using the
4:59,iPhone 15 Pro I stopped noticing how
5:02,fast the refresh rate is and it feels
5:05,normal to me it's like The New Normal
5:07,you you kind of stop appreciating the
5:09,faster refresh rate for me this is
5:11,really different than a lot of other
5:13,display Technologies I remember the
5:14,first time I used a high resolution
5:16,iPhone and compared it to an old iPhone
5:18,and on the old iPhone you could see
5:19,pixels on the display and it made things
5:22,like text look really janky so when I
5:24,got a higher resolution Retina Display
5:26,when I upgraded it to the iPhone 5S I
5:28,immediately noticed just how big of a
5:30,jump this was in display technology that
5:32,jump was so big that it ruined low
5:34,resolution displays for me and unlike
5:36,refresh rates I cannot go back to a
5:38,non-r a display after using one it is
5:41,visually obvious to me throughout my
5:43,experience so while high refresh rate is
5:45,nice for me I do appreciate it I have to
5:48,be honest it is something I can live
5:50,without then there's other new changes
5:52,that actually occurred this year with
5:53,the 15 Pro where it kind of has like
5:55,this new action button on the side so
5:57,you can map it to Quick commands and
5:59,yeah I I kind of mapped it to the camera
6:01,so I could quickly open the camera
6:03,whenever I needed to but I kind of think
6:05,that at least unlik the pro Max that I
6:07,use the buttons kind of placed a little
6:08,too high for me to constantly hit it all
6:10,the time and there's just also a lot of
6:12,other camera shortcuts that you can use
6:13,natively on the phone but honestly I I
6:15,mostly just open up my phone and just
6:17,hit the camera app I'm just so used to
6:19,that kind of muscle memory at this point
6:21,that it really makes it hard for me to
6:23,use the action button and even though
6:25,this is a feature I was looking forward
6:27,to it was something I was excited about
6:28,and thought I would be using all the the
6:29,time I kind of haven't been and I think
6:31,a lot of other users have been
6:32,experiencing that as well the iPhone
6:34,15's reliable mute switch may be old but
6:37,yeah it's been with us since the
6:38,conception of the iPhone it's hardwired
6:40,into my brain at this point that this is
6:42,a feature on the iPhone and even though
6:44,I use my iPhone on mute most of the time
6:47,I still do kind of enjoy having a
6:49,physical mute switch on the phone I
6:51,think in a lot of ways The Best of Both
6:52,Worlds would to kind of bring that back
6:55,on the uh iPhone 15 Pro maybe put the
6:57,mute switch on the other side on the top
6:59,and then then give us both options
7:00,because I kind of miss not having that
7:02,switch and a lot of the hyped up changes
7:05,to the 15 Pro kind of had me wondering
7:07,like at this point am I overpaying for
7:09,the iPhone if I'm not using a lot of
7:11,these features because in a lot of ways
7:13,honestly the experience felt very
7:15,similar but then I ran into something
7:18,something that started to change my mind
7:20,about the value proposition of the 15
7:22,Pro that I didn't expect to be talking
7:25,about for a follow-up review and that is
7:28,performance this is the second year that
7:30,Apple has failed to put the most recent
7:32,chip into the normal iPhone and the
7:34,normal iPhone basically gets stuck with
7:36,an a16 chip from last year's iPhone 14
7:38,pro while the iPhone 15 pro and pro Max
7:41,are the only new phones to technically
7:43,get a new chip the A7 Pro chip I know I
7:46,know it's a little confusing but stick
7:47,with me here now when I talk about lack
7:49,of performance I don't mean the
7:50,day-to-day activities we all do on our
7:52,smartphones iPhones for like the last
7:54,few Generations feel about the same in
7:55,day-to-day performance both of these
7:57,iPhones are going to open apps quickly
7:59,they're both super fluid and smooth with
8:01,their animations minus this not having
8:03,120 HZ and both phones have enough
8:05,memory to keep apps open for a long time
8:08,most users are never going to notice the
8:10,difference between the a16 or the a17
8:13,chip because most users cannot take full
8:16,advantage of the additional power the A7
8:19,Pro chip has but it does have a distinct
8:22,difference in one area that could
8:24,potentially reach the mass
8:27,market and that is gaming if you own an
8:30,iPhone 15 or anything before that not a
8:33,pro go to the app store and try and
8:36,download a game called resid evil
8:37,Village or Resident Evil 4 remake and
8:39,you'll see that even on your brand new
8:41,iPhone 15 the one that just launched 3
8:44,months ago it is incapable of playing
8:47,these games that's because these games
8:49,need the latest Hardware with the
8:51,advanced graphics on the iPhone 15 Pros
8:54,a17 Pro chip which can actually handle
8:57,Hardware raate tracing on on the chip
9:00,which is a requirement for these games
9:01,because these are console level games
9:04,that literally just launched on systems
9:06,like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox series X
9:10,now yes there are visual downgrades on
9:11,the iPhone 15 pro versions of these
9:13,games and there's a lot of
9:14,oversharpening especially on the
9:16,character models but the fact that these
9:17,games are even running on the iPhone 15
9:20,Pro is outstanding like for example a
9:22,very popular gaming console right now is
9:24,the Nintendo switch it's an older
9:26,console but it literally does not have
9:28,the hardware power to run these games
9:31,that are running on an iPhone so the
9:33,fact that these demanding games are
9:34,running on something like the iPhone
9:36,which again literally doesn't even have
9:37,a fan in it the Nintendo switch does
9:39,have a fan in it is impressive and it
9:42,makes you wonder if the iPhone 15 Pro
9:44,and say maybe the next 3 to four years
9:46,which is like about the average length
9:48,that people keep their smartphones for
9:50,might be able to fully compete in a
9:52,mobile gaming Market if more of these
9:56,console level Games come out on the
9:58,phone you might technically not need a
10:01,dedicated handheld console to play a lot
10:04,of these games anymore and the iPhone
10:06,might just be good enough for that I
10:08,don't know if it will because to make
10:10,the best of it you do need some like
10:11,third party accessories like a gaming
10:13,controller to really play these games
10:15,but I I think the point remains is that
10:17,the hardware on this is kind of
10:19,extremely capable I know this is kind of
10:21,pie in the sky thinking I know a lot of
10:23,games aren't available on the 15 Pro yet
10:25,and yeah for most people they're not
10:28,playing conso caliber games on their
10:30,iPhone the majority of people play iOS
10:33,mobile games those will still run on the
10:35,regular iPhone 15 but as someone that is
10:37,into gaming this is one of the most
10:39,impressive things to me the iPhone 15
10:43,pro has exclusive games for it that do
10:48,run pretty well and it's something that
10:51,the iPhone 15 just isn't capable of it
10:54,cannot play those aleaa level title
10:57,games so if you're interested in gaming
10:59,yeah the 15 pro has a really nice
11:02,exclusive feature going for it and
11:04,exclusive features are something that
11:06,maybe the iPhone 15 would be capable of
11:08,doing in this next area and that's the
11:10,camera system now don't get me wrong the
11:12,regular camera on the iPhone 15 it's
11:14,outstanding like if you're using the
11:15,main lens on the iPhone 15 and the main
11:18,lens on the iPhone 15 Pro and you're
11:20,taking side by-side shots with the 48
11:22,megapixel camera system I honestly don't
11:25,think I could tell you which phone took
11:26,which photo they are both very very
11:29,similar and both camera systems take
11:31,fantastic photos these are the best
11:34,iPhone photos that they've ever looked
11:37,right and for me and a lot of other
11:39,reviewers these are the best overall
11:41,camera systems ever put into a phone now
11:44,yes we all know the iPhone 15 pro has
11:46,some exclusive camera features things
11:48,like the 3x or 5x zoom lens just
11:50,literally isn't on the regular iPhone 15
11:53,and I do miss not having that third zoom
11:55,lens on my iPhone 15 when I'm using it
11:57,but it's not a deal breaker because for
12:00,most instances I still want to use the
12:02,main wideangle lens because those take
12:05,the best photos they get really crisp by
12:07,default 24 megapixel shots and you can
12:10,still utilize the software 2x lens on
12:13,the iPhone 15 which crops the 48
12:15,megapixel sensor to imitate a natural 2x
12:19,Zoom range and Hardware wise there's a
12:21,couple other differences with the camera
12:22,system on the 15 Pro but that's kind of
12:25,not what I miss about the 15 Pro's
12:27,camera system because technically what I
12:30,miss on the 15 Pros camera system should
12:32,be possible on the normal iPhone 15 and
12:36,that is the software this phone is kind
12:38,of software locked in photo and video
12:41,features that the 15 pro has now
12:43,normally I would boil this down to chip
12:45,performance differences just like we saw
12:47,in gaming but the iPhone 15 is using the
12:50,same a16 chip as the iPhone 14 pro and
12:54,that iPhone 14 pro has camera software
12:57,features that aren't on the iPhone 15
13:01,namely the regular 15 does not get
13:03,access to shooting Pro Raw photos or
13:05,prores video and basically what those
13:08,modes allow you to do is to capture more
13:11,data they are less compressed versions
13:14,uh in the case of pro raw it might be
13:15,the full pixel readout but for proes
13:17,video it's basically less uh compressed
13:20,video footage and what you can do with
13:22,that uh is take that into editing
13:25,software and you have a lot more
13:27,information to work with you can kind of
13:29,stretch that video footage uh in more
13:32,ways you can you know color it
13:33,differently uh you can you know change
13:35,the highlights the Shadows all that
13:37,stuff right you get a lot more control
13:39,with it when you're editing these photos
13:41,and even in the case of like Pro raw uh
13:45,photos you actually get more resolution
13:47,and detail out of it uh than the normal
13:50,camera system and as someone that makes
13:51,YouTube videos I kind of appreciate that
13:54,especially the pro reses log video that
13:57,is on the iPhone 15 pro model which
13:59,hands down has to be the best smartphone
14:01,video footage that I have ever seen it
14:04,looks really good and just gives you so
14:06,much more flexibility when working with
14:08,iPhone footage now yes this is a niche
14:10,feature people like my mom my dad people
14:13,in my family and even close friends
14:16,people that are even really into Tech
14:18,might not even touch this feature most
14:20,of the time when you're sharing photos
14:22,or videos online anyway it's getting
14:24,compressed anyway so in real world usage
14:25,scenarios having access to higher
14:28,fidelity video or higher Fidelity photos
14:32,they're kind of unnecessary and most
14:34,users I believe probably wouldn't even
14:36,make the sacrifice to use these features
14:39,uh because they take up so much storage
14:41,space again these are larger
14:43,uncompressed file sizes like I have the
14:45,second highest storage tier the 512 gab
14:48,iPhone 15 Pro Max and I am already
14:52,basically using up all my storage I
14:53,could I barely have enough space to
14:55,shoot these prores videos if I don't
14:58,start deleting stuff and I have to
14:59,resort to shooting off external drives
15:02,which you know uh shout out to the
15:03,iPhone 15 and 15 Pro for getting another
15:06,handy feature the USBC Port we didn't
15:08,talk about that but yeah they have USBC
15:09,ports but you know the 15 pro has a
15:11,faster one so you can hook up external
15:12,storage to it and shoot directly on
15:14,there again most users probably aren't
15:16,going to connect external storage to
15:18,their iPhones and start shooting video
15:19,off it right like that's just not
15:20,realistic to expect but when you can
15:23,utilize those features when you're used
15:24,to doing things like that already uh you
15:27,do miss out on having that feature on
15:29,the regular iPhone 15 and that's kind of
15:32,what I miss going to the iPhone 15 it's
15:35,a lot of the software locked exclusivity
15:38,features that should technically be
15:40,possible on the regular 15 and for the
15:42,most part uh I would be fine using a
15:45,regular iPhone 15 if it had these
15:47,software features so ultimately even
15:49,though most people probably wouldn't
15:51,take advantage of these software
15:52,features on the regular 15 I do believe
15:54,Apple should give you at least the
15:56,freedom of choice to to make those
15:58,choices if you want to use those
15:59,features with that being said though I
16:02,think the iPhone 15 is still a great
16:04,phone right it fixed a lot of problems
16:06,with the regular iPhone 14 it was you
16:09,know that phone was lackluster I did not
16:11,recommend the iPhone 14 and with the new
16:14,Dynamic Island design the the most
16:16,important features like that new 48
16:18,megapixel camera system and USBC right
16:21,like it has the features that most users
16:23,want and care about and the only problem
16:25,for the iPhone 15 is the pricing upgrade
16:28,structure because for $100 more you can
16:30,get an iPhone 15 plus with a bigger 6.7
16:32,in display and more battery life but
16:34,then you kind of look at that pricing
16:36,ladder right you have $100 more and you
16:37,can upgrade to the pro model but if you
16:40,want it that bigger display well I think
16:42,this is where Apple's pricing ladder is
16:44,a slippery slope or a slippery ladder
16:46,you know what I'm saying right Apple
16:47,makes it very tempting and very easy to
16:49,spend a couple hundred dollars to get
16:52,the more premium phone but most people
16:55,probably should just save that extra
16:56,cash perhaps that's a video top for
16:58,another day
17:07,though no no no no no hold on hold on
17:10,hold on I'm not going to make you wait
17:12,here to answer the question right is the
17:14,iPhone 15 worth it and are the upgrades
17:17,on the iPhone 15 Pro really that
17:20,important well unlike last year again
17:23,where I thought the iPhone 14 was a skip
17:24,the regular iPhone 15 it's a really good
17:26,phone I recommend it and the upgrades to
17:29,the iPhone 15 Pro really only apply to
17:31,you if you really want those Niche use
17:34,case differences if you don't care about
17:36,the 120hz display if you don't care
17:38,about you know these exclusive console
17:40,level games if you don't care about
17:41,these software locked camera features
17:44,well then yeah the regular iPhone 15 and
17:46,15 plus are worth it you should
17:48,definitely save your money and get them
17:50,instead of going for the pro phones but
17:52,with that being said after using both
17:54,phones for 3 months this is kind of one
17:57,of the first years where the pro phone
17:58,feels like it really is getting
18:00,exclusive Pro features features that
18:02,aren't designed for most users but if
18:04,you want those features you'll be sad
18:06,without them if you pick the regular 15
18:08,so if you really do want those features
