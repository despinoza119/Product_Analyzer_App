0:00,this video is really geared towards
0:01,iPhone 11 and earlier individuals if
0:04,you're rocking one of those devices
0:05,you're probably looking at the iPhone 15
0:07,as your next upgrade if you're rocking
0:09,an iPhone 12 and I said this in my last
0:11,video it really depends on your battery
0:13,is the battery pretty poor you find the
0:15,phone to slow down a bit if that's the
0:17,case then the iPhone 15 is a good update
0:20,candidate if you're rocking an iPhone 13
0:22,or 14 I'd probably wait another couple
0:24,of years now this is a incremental
0:27,update like it has been over the past
0:28,few years but I think this year is a bit
0:30,more significant since they changed a
0:31,few things but you know at the same time
0:34,it's your same iPhone you know last
0:36,year's iPhone 14 colors were very bright
0:38,and bold like you have this very bright
0:40,red this year on the iPhone 15 and 15
0:43,plus the colors are a bit more muted now
0:46,this really comes down to your personal
0:47,preference I like this it looks
0:49,minimalistic it looks super clean but
0:51,others might feel like they like last
0:53,year's colors better the benefit of
0:56,using this type of color is that they
0:58,could Frost the back glass
1:00,which means you don't say fingerprints
1:03,I've been touching all these devices on
1:05,the back equally and as you can see here
1:08,the fingerprints on last year's iPhone
1:10,14 are much more substantial right off
1:13,the bat when you pick up an iPhone 14
1:15,and a 15 in your hand you'll notice how
1:18,it feels on the 14 the edges were a bit
1:21,squared off they were slightly sharper
1:23,not as sharp as the 14 pro or Pro Max
1:26,but you know it felt like a box of your
1:28,phone this year's iPhone 15 they rounded
1:31,them off like it just feels super
1:33,comfortable to hold this is good news
1:35,for those of you out there who plan to
1:37,rock their phone without a case it's
1:39,just gonna be a little bit nicer in
1:41,terms of how it feels now it could be my
1:43,mind playing tricks on me but it does
1:44,feel like the buttons on the new iPhone
1:46,15 are a bit clickier maybe it's because
1:48,the edges are a bit rougher compared to
1:51,the smoother ones on last year's model
1:52,but they definitely feel nicer to click
1:55,there is a difference in weight it's
1:57,ever so slightly lighter like a gram
1:58,you're not going to feel it like you
2:01,would with the pro Max in the Pro Max 14
2:03,from last year but yes it's technically
2:06,lighter overall but it's the same
2:08,storage options starting at 128
2:10,gigabytes and you have the same size
2:12,screen at 6.12 inches but the big deal
2:15,this year is that you have a completely
2:18,different looking Notch they are
2:21,incorporating the dynamic Island from
2:24,last year's iPhone 14 pro and they've
2:27,placed it on the iPhone 15. now quite
2:29,frankly it's not a must-have feature but
2:32,I do think it's clever because it takes
2:35,something that doesn't look the best and
2:38,actually gives it a use case and you
2:40,know more manufacturers are adding
2:42,capabilities to it like if you use Uber
2:44,or if you use doordash it will use the
2:47,dynamic Notch to play some of its
2:49,activity which is kind of handy because
2:51,you know you could be looking at
2:52,something else and then you stare up at
2:54,your Dynamic Island and then you'll see
2:56,you know some information that could be
2:58,important to you the camera on the front
3:00,is still 12 megapixels I don't think
3:02,much has changed there but you guys
3:04,watch this video and let me know if you
3:05,see any differences so right now you're
3:07,looking at the front facing cameras of
3:08,the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 15 they
3:11,should be pretty much identical but you
3:14,guys let me know how the microphones
3:15,sound and
3:17,if you notice any visual differences
3:20,but what is different is the port on the
3:22,bottom of the phone I know you guys know
3:23,already that this is now rocking USBC
3:26,it's a bit different than the USBC
3:28,that's on the Pro Models those have a
3:31,transfer speed of 10 gigabits per second
3:32,and Apple's allowing you to do a lot
3:35,more with it like connect external
3:36,drives monitors microphones you name it
3:39,it will probably work with that type c
3:40,Port but with the iPhone 15 you're very
3:43,limited the speeds are identical to
3:45,lightning you're only getting 480
3:47,megabits per second so it's not the
3:50,fastest transfer rate which I imagine
3:52,most people buying an iPhone 15 anyways
3:54,probably won't need that often and you
3:57,can't connect devices to it the only
3:59,thing you can do now is reverse charge
4:01,so if I have a pair of airpods I can
4:03,connect a USB type-c cable from the
4:05,phone to the airpods and they will
4:07,charge if I have a type c to lightning
4:09,cable I can charge last year's iPhone 14
4:11,and of course everybody who's rocking an
4:14,Android device you can charge their
4:16,phone as well now if you're charging two
4:18,iPhones at the exact same time two
4:20,iPhone 15s basically what happens is the
4:24,iPhone 15 with the least amount of
4:26,charge will be the one that starts
4:28,charging first there's still two
4:30,speakers on the phone for stereo sound I
4:32,don't see a big difference in terms of
4:33,sound quality and it could be my ears
4:35,playing tricks on me but the new iPhone
4:37,15 sounds a little bit brighter whereas
4:40,the old iPhone 14 has a little bit more
4:43,low end if that makes any sense but
4:45,overall there's not much of a difference
4:53,[Music]
4:56,thank you
5:00,[Applause]
5:03,the display is interesting because you
5:06,still have that OLED panel and yes I
5:09,know it's 60 hertz still and look we can
5:11,take this in two ways as an Enthusiast
5:13,as someone who's like a hardcore nerd
5:15,when it comes to this stuff I couldn't
5:17,do it I can't do 60 hertz on a phone
5:19,anymore I'm way past that but if you
5:21,look at the market data if you look at
5:22,everything for instance on what apple is
5:25,selling most people just don't know what
5:28,a high refresh rate is most people don't
5:30,know what 120 hertz is most people don't
5:33,simply care and this is just one way for
5:36,Apple to differentiate their iPhone 15
5:38,from their obviously Pro lineup
5:40,eventually one day all these displays
5:42,will have a higher refresh rate but
5:44,until their consumers actually care
5:46,there's not really much of a reason for
5:49,Apple to care to put a high refresh
5:51,display on either of these phones now
5:53,you could make the argument is that the
5:55,customers deserve more right even if
5:57,they don't understand what's going on
5:58,and I get it I get where you're coming
6:00,from but
6:01,I don't know I don't think it matters
6:03,for most people but for me personally I
6:05,have to have a high refresh rate now
6:07,they did change the display driver on
6:08,the new iPhone 15 so it's supposed to be
6:11,a bit more efficient which should
6:13,translate into slightly better battery
6:15,life and look the battery life on these
6:17,phones have been really good like I was
6:19,easily to able to get through the entire
6:22,day without any issues like I've been
6:24,using these phones very very heavily and
6:26,it easily lasts through the entire day
6:29,but here's the thing you got the plus
6:30,over here
6:31,so if you want like insane battery life
6:34,go for the Plus instead because you get
6:36,the bigger display and the bigger
6:38,battery but everything else remains
6:40,equal so that's the only benefit for
6:42,going for the plus it's just bigger
6:44,display bigger battery but you do have
6:46,to spend another hundred dollars now the
6:48,iPhone 15 does not get the new action
6:50,button that's specifically reserved for
6:52,the Pro Models but my guess is maybe
6:53,next year it will trickle down to the
6:56,iPhone 16. it's still a mute switch
6:58,which I feel like is fine for most
6:59,people but you know if you want that
7:01,action button you do have to pay more I
7:03,will say that the performance on the new
7:05,iPhone 15 is noticeable it's the same
7:07,processor that was inside last year's
7:09,iPhone 14 pro which is the a16 and I
7:13,didn't really notice that much of a
7:14,difference in everyday use I didn't
7:16,really notice that much of a difference
7:17,in terms of gaming but the one area
7:20,where I did notice a difference was
7:23,actual
7:25,photography like if you are taking
7:27,photos at night or anything that
7:30,requires heavy processing the a16 made a
7:33,difference I didn't have to wait as long
7:35,for the picture to be taken which I
7:38,found very weird on the iPhone 14 where
7:40,it just took a little bit longer but
7:42,look regardless of whether you go for 15
7:43,or 14 these processes are still at the
7:46,top of their game like they're still so
7:48,fast you know like the a15 that's inside
7:50,the 14 model may not be the fastest chip
7:53,this year in terms of what Android
7:55,offers but it's right up there and this
7:58,a16 is still faster than anything that
8:00,you know Qualcomm or mediatek has
8:03,released so I feel like these phones are
8:05,doing such a good job of future proofing
8:07,themselves in terms of actual
8:09,performance now the camera situation is
8:11,very interesting because it is using a
8:13,48 megapixel camera which is the same
8:16,size as the iPhone 14 pro last year but
8:18,I don't think it's the same 48 megapixel
8:21,Hardware because I was looking at the
8:23,aperture and this new one is using F1
8:25,1.7 whereas last year's model was F 1.8
8:28,either way I'm not seeing a big
8:31,difference between this new iPhone 15
8:33,and iPhone 14 in terms of overall
8:36,quality like don't get me wrong it's now
8:38,taking photos at 24 megapixels instead
8:40,of 12 which means when I zoom in a
8:42,little bit it seems to be a slightly bit
8:44,sharper you just get a cleaner picture
8:47,overall and sometimes it will produce a
8:49,bit more contrast but don't get me wrong
8:51,like there are times where this iPhone
8:53,14 has slightly more dynamic range but
8:57,the differences are nothing major like I
8:59,feel like if you were to use the same
9:01,camera from last year and had it in the
9:03,same phone you probably wouldn't be that
9:05,upset because they produce such similar
9:08,results the good news though is that
9:10,when you are taking photos with the
9:11,iPhone 15 they take it faster like any
9:14,sort of major processing happens faster
9:16,on this phone because the A7 or a16
9:20,rather is a faster chip overall and when
9:22,you're talking nighttime photography the
9:24,same things translate over to there
9:26,sometimes I'd actually get a bit more
9:28,dynamic range with the iPhone 14 but I
9:30,found those shots were taken faster with
9:32,the iPhone 15 and obviously things
9:34,tended to be a bit sharper because there
9:36,was more information to work with now if
9:39,you're planning on buying an iPhone 15
9:40,you're gonna like the new portrait
9:41,effect it allows you to take a regular
9:42,photo then turn it into a portrait later
9:44,which is kind of great because sometimes
9:46,I'll take a photo and I'm like oh man
9:48,you know I kind of wish I blurred out
9:49,the background but you can do that in
9:51,post all you got to do is go into your
9:53,photos choose one so this is one of me
9:55,and my son hit portrait on the bottom
9:57,left and then I can change the depth of
9:59,the background and automatically blurs
10:01,me and everything behind my son and puts
10:03,him directly in Focus now you can do
10:05,this with portrait as well so let's say
10:08,you took a portrait shot for example and
10:11,you know you wanted to unblur the
10:13,background all you have to do is
10:16,basically go back into that photo hit
10:18,edit again and since this is a portrait
10:21,shot already you can go ahead and adjust
10:23,the depth to bring bring the background
10:26,into the foreground so you can see
10:28,everything instead now the cool thing
10:29,about the 15 Pro and the 15 Pro Max
10:32,those allow you to properly blur the
10:34,foreground and open up the background so
10:37,you have a little bit more of control
10:38,now unfortunately you don't get prores
10:40,or prores raw with the iPhone 15 but I
10:42,feel like most users buying this phone
10:43,probably don't care about that but you
10:45,know you can shoot 4K 60. I did shoot a
10:48,couple of 4K 30 Films it again looks
10:50,identical to the iPhone 14. I'm not
10:52,seeing a big difference but is it me or
10:56,does the iPhone 14 have slightly better
10:59,image stabilization even when I used
11:02,quick action or action mode rather the
11:05,video looked a little bit smoother on
11:07,the iPhone 14 from last year now the big
11:11,update with this new 48 megapixel sensor
11:14,is that you get a lot less lens flare
11:16,and one of the comments I heard in my
11:18,previous video was that some of you
11:19,actually liked it because it added some
11:22,creativity to the video you were taking
11:23,and depending on what your doing it
11:26,absolutely can but if you look at this
11:28,video here you can see that the lens
11:29,flare on the iPhone 14 is completely
11:31,obstructing what you can see in the
11:34,video now in terms of heat management it
11:36,does get a little bit hot if you're
11:37,using this for a long period of time
11:39,especially if you're gaming a lot so it
11:41,will throttle but you know I didn't
11:43,really feel the effect no games dropped
11:45,any frames everything was nice and
11:46,smooth and I feel like this is just you
11:48,know what you get when you buy an iPhone
11:50,so here's the thing I like the iPhone
11:52,15. I know it doesn't have everything we
11:55,want in terms of like a higher refresh
11:57,rate and all that kind of stuff but I
11:59,feel like for those of you out there who
12:00,just want a solid phone a good phone an
12:03,iPhone the iPhone 15 really checks those
12:05,boxes now it's a phone that costs 799
12:08,dollars and I think you know if you're
12:10,looking at this and you want better
12:11,battery life and a bigger screen I feel
12:14,like the plus model is actually worth a
12:16,hundred dollars more whereas last year I
12:18,might have said you know just pay the
12:19,extra and get the pro Max instead but
12:21,because the pro Max is a couple hundred
12:24,dollars more expense as of this year
12:25,compared to last year because they got
12:27,rid of the base storage I feel like the
12:29,plus makes a lot more sense if you just
12:31,want that bigger display again not an
12:34,upgrade if you have a 13 or 14 this is a
12:37,fantastic upgrade if you're coming from
12:38,an iPhone 11 and earlier if you're
12:40,rocking the 12 if you're happy with your
12:43,experience right now and your battery
12:44,seems to be okay maybe you wait another
12:46,year either way I hope you guys enjoyed
12:48,this video if you did feel free to hit
12:49,the like button if you're new to the
12:50,channel subscribe and I'll see you guys
12:52,in the next one
