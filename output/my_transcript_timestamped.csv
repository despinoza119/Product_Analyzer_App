0:00,this is the Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra
0:02,this is the iPhone 15 Pro Max these
0:05,phone cameras are about to go to
0:07,battle and so am I last year we tested
0:10,the iPhone 15 Pro Max against the
0:11,Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra and the iPhone
0:13,1 with 6.5 points to 3.5 so let's see if
0:16,Samsung's AI powered 2024 Flagship can
0:19,claim Redemption oh and the loser of
0:21,this video gets shot by an actual
0:24,tank so I want to start with
0:27,slow-mo can you see the happy look on my
0:29,face this is the look of a man who has
0:30,been asking nay begging companies to
0:32,show some love to the feature for about
0:34,5 years and finally finally the s24
0:37,ultra brings it the phone's capable of
0:39,shooting 4K footage at 120 frames per
0:41,second and I can confirm this is true 4K
0:45,slow-mo with no strings attached will
0:47,you notice the difference versus the
0:48,iPhone when watching back on your phone
0:49,screen probably not but can you tell
0:52,when you blow it up onto a TV absolutely
0:54,plus combine that with the fact that any
0:56,video on the Samsung can now be
0:57,instantly slowed down even further on
0:59,the spot by just holding down on it and
1:01,I think we can safely say that Samsung
1:02,has once again become the slow King now
1:05,because slow-mo itself is probably not
1:07,important enough to be its own category
1:09,we bundle it together into the overall
1:11,category called special modes which also
1:13,includes portrait mode video as well as
1:15,Ultra close-up macro shots but since
1:17,both of those features are very
1:18,comparable between the two phones like
1:20,this right here is portrait mode video
1:22,and this is what both phones macr shots
1:23,look like the iPhone can get closer
1:25,which is really useful but Samsung's
1:27,processing makes their shots look
1:28,crispier I think it's time to hand the
1:30,overall category of special modes to
1:32,Samsung selfie wise well I mean
1:35,Samsung's last phone beat the iPhone so
1:37,its successor naturally wins too the way
1:40,I see it is the iPhone is a very
1:42,consistent 8 out of 10 for selfies never
1:44,exceptional but always good the Samsung
1:47,though swings between a nine most of the
1:49,time with Samsung's best being
1:51,definitely better than the iPhone's best
1:52,and than the occasional six where it
1:54,seems to either not quite capture in
1:55,time leading to slightly softer than
1:57,expected face details or just blurs the
2:00,face of someone you've unwittingly
2:01,pulled into your photo where the iPhone
2:03,often still manages to keep it sharp but
2:05,85% of the time I think this takes
2:07,better shots they're crispier they're
2:09,more impressive they often look as good
2:11,as rear camera photos and they make you
2:13,look nice whereas often times when I
2:15,take photos with the iPhone I just feel
2:16,like I look so rough that I'm half
2:19,tempted to run the photos through face
2:20,tune before showing them to anyone now
2:23,one of the biggest changes we've been
2:24,told the s24 ultra is going to come with
2:25,is improved noise reduction and I'm
2:28,going to be honest with you if Samsung
2:29,actually managers who fix their noise
2:31,problem well that's bigger than slow-mo
2:33,that's bigger than all of this AI stuff
2:35,why because noisy videos are the single
2:37,biggest weakness of Samsung's cameras by
2:39,far and so if they're actually gone now
2:41,that's like finally cutting off the
2:43,weights and letting this thing fly
2:45,allowing people to finally focus on all
2:47,the awesome stuff these cameras can do
2:49,without having to constantly caveat it
2:51,with this annoying side effect that
2:53,seems to follow Sam around like a shadow
2:55,so is it better I would say it is faces
2:59,are crisper than they were on the s23
3:01,ultra and it does get less noise in the
3:03,videos you take and you know at times
3:06,the s24 ultra shoots such good front
3:08,camera video that looks so real it can
3:11,make the iPhone's footage look fake and
3:12,unnatural Samsung's done a lot of things
3:14,right here but the main problem of the
3:17,darker areas of your shot suffering from
3:19,ugly amounts of noise that hasn't been
3:21,solved especially when you move the
3:22,camera it's 5% better than last year but
3:25,like you know still 50% behind the
3:27,iPhone I really want to give some the
3:30,draw here because of how good I know it
3:31,can be but in their current states if
3:34,someone offered me one of these two
3:35,cameras for the purposes of vlogging
3:37,until Samsung fixes this and also
3:39,improves the dynamic range to the
3:41,iPhones level I would pick the iPhone so
3:44,far though in this battle that is 2
3:45,points to one point so this camera
3:48,comparison is already a very different
3:50,story to the last one and we might just
3:52,be shooting an iPhone today and what
3:55,really starts to cement Samsung's lead
3:56,here is the camera app itself which is
3:59,actually one of the biggest changes
4:00,compared to when the s23 is launched
4:02,last year it looks better for starters
4:04,with icons having been cleared up and
4:05,animations updated but it's also
4:07,functionally better it's smoother like
4:09,navigating between the different modes
4:11,and more surprisingly being able to zoom
4:13,all the way in and out is now nearly as
4:15,smooth as the iPhone I have no idea why
4:18,it's taken this long to get here but let
4:20,me tell you it feels pretty good to be
4:22,here you can now just tap to change your
4:24,photo resolution and changing your video
4:26,properties makes way more sense too this
4:28,right here is the kind of practical
4:30,compact menu design that it would be
4:32,really cool to see apple do too cuz I
4:34,get that the iPhone's camera really
4:35,tries to keep things simple but this is
4:37,now pretty decluttered but also while
4:40,being able to access all your different
4:41,camera options without having to
4:43,navigate to a completely separate part
4:44,of the phone to change half of them and
4:47,you actually just get way more options
4:48,with the Samsung 2o you know those kind
4:50,of ultra Niche things that you think
4:52,only you care about and no one would
4:54,actually make a setting for yeah Samsung
4:57,gives you that level of control things
4:58,like if you set the camera to 50 map or
5:01,200 map mode whether or not the camera
5:03,should keep those as the default the
5:04,next time you open the camera app or
5:06,like whether you want to swipe down of
5:07,your shutter button to either burst fire
5:09,photos or create an instant GIF and the
5:11,biggest thing with this s24 Ultra is
5:13,that it's faster to take photos too now
5:15,it's still not as fast as the iPhone but
5:17,there's no longer a massive gap between
5:19,them and I'd say the Samsung shoots fast
5:21,enough now that it doesn't feel like a
5:23,problem it doesn't stand out as a
5:24,sluggish camera like it used to the only
5:26,remaining weakness of this camera app is
5:28,the fact that it's a little hard to use
5:30,one-handed it's slightly the sharp boxy
5:32,shape of the phone but mostly just the
5:34,fact that many of the options are fixed
5:35,at the top instead of how the iPhone can
5:37,bring them all to your thumb with a
5:38,single swipe so I came pretty close at
5:41,this point to just calling this category
5:42,a draw and moving on but the thing
5:44,that's really tipped the scales for me
5:46,is the screen brightness on the Samsung
5:48,I did not expect to find it as useful as
5:50,I have but if you allow Samsung's
5:52,automatic brightness to take over it
5:54,gets so bright that even though I've
5:56,never felt like shooting Outdoors was an
5:57,issue on the iPhone this screen is so
5:59,clear that it makes it feel like an
6:01,issue in comparison so yeah I think
6:03,Samsung's done enough this generation to
6:05,turn the camera app all the way from A
6:07,Loss into a win and related to this I
6:10,think Now's the Time to introduce a new
6:11,category into our camera comparisons
6:13,going forward editing features I've
6:15,thought about doing this for a long time
6:17,but the s24 feels like a very obvious
6:19,place to start it feels like we're on
6:21,the brink of a new era in which thanks
6:23,to really powerful artificial
6:25,intelligence it's no longer just about
6:27,the photos and videos you can take but
6:29,also about the photos and videos you can
6:30,make or to put it another way a lot of
6:32,the camera's capability now comes after
6:34,the shot has been captured so who does
6:37,that side of the experience better well
6:39,in the iPhones Corner the editor is
6:41,fairly simple it definitely leaves you
6:43,wanting more like I really wish there
6:44,was the ability to make a video that
6:46,you've taken two times or three times
6:48,speed I've needed that quite a bit but
6:50,credit where credits due everything that
6:52,is here is so fast you're never waiting
6:54,for any action there's no loading bars
6:57,making photo and video edits happens
6:58,literally as smoothly as changing your
7:00,volume and you want to crop something
7:02,you don't even need to be in the editor
7:04,you just zoom in while browsing and
7:05,click the crop button but then in
7:07,Samsung's corner you absolutely have
7:09,more options like you just swipe up on a
7:11,shot now and thanks to the new Pro
7:13,visual engine that understands photos
7:14,better you have a bunch of suggested
7:16,edits like background effect which is
7:18,actually pretty cool you can add the
7:19,portrait mode background blower but also
7:21,change the style of an existing portrait
7:23,mode shot to make it look like you're
7:25,having a particularly action-packed kind
7:27,of day I love this feature there's a lot
7:28,of options now there's remaster which is
7:30,usually a general brightening and
7:32,sharpening of a photo more often than
7:34,not it does make a positive difference
7:35,but it's more for older shots taken on
7:37,much worse cameras than this it doesn't
7:39,really do much to already good photos oh
7:41,but also the ability to erase
7:43,Reflections which if you like me find
7:45,yourself on a London balcony with the
7:46,most incredible view but a massive glass
7:48,sheet in front of you can be a very
7:50,powerful effect and I love that these
7:52,features are mostly just a tap away it
7:54,takes away that whole uh can I really be
7:56,bothered to fully jump into an editor
7:58,for this one specific spefic photo the
8:00,phone takes away that load from you and
8:02,I haven't even talked about the biggest
8:03,change to Samsung's editing which is the
8:05,new generative AI image editor which is
8:08,pretty good if you're like I used to be
8:10,and your current default for repairing
8:12,photos is like the healing brush then
8:14,this very much will be a revolutionary
8:16,Step Up in being able to move subjects
8:17,to extend your image and erase things
8:19,you didn't want to be there it does need
8:21,an internet connection and it's not
8:22,super fast but the upside is that it's
8:24,kind of like those really powerful AI
8:26,websites without needing a monthly
8:28,subscription like most of ask you for oh
8:30,at least not yet Samsung's saying that
8:32,these AI features will only be free till
8:34,the end of 2025 which I mean it makes
8:37,sense they do create a significant load
8:39,on Samsung servers but that's all the
8:41,more reason that we should be demanding
8:42,AI features that run offline on your
8:44,phone and don't require them but even
8:47,with that caveat I have to say Samsung's
8:49,editing Suite is way ahead of Apple's
8:51,and the pressure is really on for the
8:52,iPhone to start integrating AI in a more
8:55,explicit way very soon right I think
8:58,it's time we address the zoom zo
8:59,situation ever since Samsung decided to
9:01,go all in on this whole Space Zoom thing
9:03,with the s20 ultra regardless of how
9:05,important or unimportant you think Zoom
9:07,is one thing you can say is they have
9:09,consistently dominated the category but
9:12,within the span of just a few years the
9:13,iPhones have kind of under the radar
9:15,gone from pretty bad to very good at
9:17,Zoom 2 partly because the zoom lens
9:19,magnifications have gone up from 2x to
9:21,3x to now 5x on the iPhone 15 Pro Max
9:24,partly because of New Image processing
9:26,techniques like photonic engine which
9:28,can sharpen up photo has taken beyond
9:30,that five times number and partly
9:31,because the iPhone takes particularly
9:33,clear noise-free zoomed in video or
9:35,leading Apple to for the first time
9:38,taking home the draw in last year's
9:40,comparison now the reason for the entire
9:42,backstory is so that you can also see
9:43,how strange it is that while all of that
9:45,is happening this time round Samsung has
9:48,decided to scale back their Zoom the
9:50,previous 10 time zoom lens and three
9:52,time zoom lens combo has been swapped
9:53,out for a five times and a three times
9:56,and it brings me no joy to say this but
9:59,as much as Samsung wants you to believe
10:00,that this 5x lens is just as good
10:02,because it's a higher resolution camera
10:04,compared to the previous 10x your
10:06,ability to zoom in far is actually
10:09,slightly worse let me show you so this
10:11,is a side by side of the s24 ultra
10:13,versus last year's s23 Ultra and you'll
10:15,see that as we start to zoom in beyond
10:17,the phone's Optical ranges it looks okay
10:19,the AI processing on the new phone is
10:21,more sophisticated than it was so your
10:22,photos don't look Ultra grainy like you
10:25,might expect them to but at the same
10:27,time you can absolutely tell that the
10:29,new phone is seeing less that it
10:31,understands what it's shooting less well
10:33,and is having to use more processing to
10:35,bring it back into line here's another
10:37,example at 100 time zoom s24 Ultra again
10:40,the actual core details less real more
10:43,artificial and okay that's fine that's
10:44,one thing but what I didn't expect to
10:46,say today is what that translates to
10:49,which is that actually now the iPhone is
10:52,the better camera for zooming in long
10:53,distances I was pretty shocked I tested
10:56,it many times in many different lighting
10:58,conditions and yet yes eight times out
11:00,of 10 the phone that doesn't even
11:01,technically let you go beyond the 25
11:03,times Zoom Ark in the camera app is
11:05,actually capturing more information than
11:07,the phone that's been letting you zoom
11:09,in a 100 times for 4 years now Samsung
11:11,is doing a lot more software processing
11:12,than the iPhone when you zoom into
11:14,things and it does sometimes work but it
11:16,also sometimes looks so clearly
11:18,oversharpened or almost like it's had to
11:20,use its imagination to guess what the
11:22,thing actually looks like that youd just
11:24,rather it didn't you'd rather the phone
11:26,just told you yeah I don't do 100 times
11:28,as opposed to you having to take the
11:30,shot first to realize one of the things
11:32,that Samsung constantly advertises
11:34,themselves as is the definitive way to
11:36,record a concept from far away and
11:39,that's kind of accurate it's something
11:40,the iPhone is distinctly not good at
11:42,with its reluctance to switch into its
11:44,zoom camera paired with those absolutely
11:46,heinous internal glass Reflections you
11:48,get from bright light sources but
11:50,Samsung does still have a noise problem
11:52,enough of a noise problem that as soon
11:54,as the lights start to fade or you start
11:56,to shoot something even remotely not
11:57,bright the iPhone video just starts to
12:00,look way more comfortable at 5x
12:02,magnification and also at 10x and Beyond
12:05,the one thing that Samsung Zoom cameras
12:06,do unarguably do better is zoom
12:08,consistency while the iPhone starts to
12:10,noticeably dip in quality when you get
12:12,to three times or four times you know
12:14,just before that five times zoom camera
12:16,activates because Samsung also has this
12:17,separate three times optical zoom camera
12:19,it can make sure that your Zoom quality
12:21,stays close to full quality anywhere
12:23,between 0.5x and 5x leading to what I
12:26,would say is an overall draw again in
12:28,the zoom category where this extra three
12:31,times lens really helped Samsung out
12:32,though is in the next one the ability to
12:34,take three times Zoom portrait mode
12:36,shots as well as five time zoom portrait
12:38,mode shots is an absolute godsend when
12:41,Apple announced that the iPhone 15 Pro
12:42,Max would have a five time zoom lens
12:44,instead of the three times that the 14
12:46,pro Max had there was a very split
12:48,reaction 50% of people loved the fact
12:50,that you now had a higher magnification
12:51,50% of people relented it for being too
12:54,much Zoom see because your zoom lens is
12:56,also generally the best lens to take
12:58,portraits now now that the phone only
12:59,has a five times that's so much Zoom
13:02,that you know when you're sitting
13:02,opposite the table from someone and you
13:04,want to take a portrait of them you are
13:06,going to have to stand up and step back
13:07,to fit them in but with the Samsung now
13:10,you don't have to compromise you get
13:11,both options at full Optical quality and
13:14,that takes it from what was already a
13:16,beastly camera for portraits with
13:18,excellent Edge detection flattering
13:19,image processing and one of the most
13:21,natural DSLR style background blow
13:23,effects to Elite here if I had to call
13:25,something this phone's specialty I'd
13:27,probably say it's this while the iPhone
13:29,can shoot portrait mode shots in 24
13:31,megapixel compared to Samsung's 12 it
13:33,can only do that when shooting portrait
13:35,modes at one times magnification which I
13:38,actually tend not to do much of because
13:40,1X isn't as pretty all right let's do
13:42,some audio testing so right now you're
13:44,hearing the microphones on the Samsung
13:45,which do sound very good indeed as they
13:47,do on the iPhone I mean not every
13:49,company pays attention to the microphone
13:51,quality of their phones these two do you
13:53,can't really go wrong either way what's
13:55,actually kind of crazy is that both
13:57,microphones are so sensitive that you
13:59,can even whisper and as long as you're
14:00,in a quiet environment you can still
14:02,pick up the sound clearly phones are
14:05,crazy nowadays where they start to
14:07,diverge though is when you get
14:08,significant background noise you know
14:10,like the sound of an active tank in the
14:12,background Samsung doesn't actually make
14:14,it sound so bad it's just that the
14:16,quality of my voice is cut into as the
14:18,phone aggressively tries to remove that
14:20,background noise whereas with the iPhone
14:22,you hear my voice pretty clearly but you
14:24,also hear the tank pretty clearly now
14:27,just before we bring this all together
14:28,and shoot one of these guys we have to
14:31,tackle the three big questions who takes
14:33,better quality photos who takes better
14:36,quality videos who handles nighttime
14:38,better so for photos does the Galaxy s24
14:41,Ultra with its Hardware improvements its
14:43,software improvements and its new Pro
14:44,visual engine significantly improve upon
14:46,the core photo quality of the s23 ultra
14:49,well I do notice the contrast of shots
14:51,looking better now it's very rare to
14:52,have a washed out photo on the s24 and
14:54,also color science it's refined although
14:58,I was would definitely be clear to say
15:00,not perfected you will still notice some
15:02,funky Lighting in the background being
15:03,enough to rock the phone's perception of
15:05,an entire scene like I took some shots
15:07,with some of you guys that I met while
15:09,filming and you can see the lighting of
15:11,the surrounding area very much bleeding
15:13,onto our faces on the Samsung or for
15:15,another example you know when you're
15:16,zooming into something very often every
15:19,one of the different Zoom magnifications
15:21,has a slightly different color profile
15:22,so my skin tone actually changes as you
15:25,go but it isn't bad and it's not always
15:27,one way there are also occasions where
15:29,the iPhone goes too far with color and
15:31,the Samsung gets it right dynamic range
15:33,used to be a blanket Samsung win iPhones
15:35,used to suck at being able to control
15:37,the overexposure of the sky but that's
15:39,not true either anymore there are cases
15:41,where Samsung does it better still but
15:42,also cases where the iPhone leads like
15:44,Samsung might overexpose your face when
15:46,Apple gets it right so they're about
15:48,even on that front but the detail is
15:51,what secures the iPhones win
15:53,interestingly just like the new iPhones
15:55,Samsung's s24 Ultra is now capable of
15:57,shooting photos in in 24 map resolution
16:00,instead of 12 sadly for Samsung though
16:02,while Apple's now made 24 mapix the
16:04,Default Resolution that just happens in
16:06,auto mode without any compromise
16:07,Samsung's 24 megapixel is restricted to
16:09,the expert raw camera app they've not
16:11,said it as a default I'm not exactly
16:13,sure why maybe they decided that it
16:15,makes the shutter time longer and
16:16,they've just worked so hard to get it
16:18,down whatever the reason the default in
16:20,auto mode and therefore what Samsung
16:21,recommends you use is their 12 map mode
16:24,and that means detail does still lag
16:26,behind the Apple sometimes you'll notice
16:28,the difference Clarity a lot like you
16:30,can zoom in a whole extra time on the
16:31,iPhone and get the same level of clarity
16:33,other times it's pretty negligible but
16:35,the Gap exists of course this being a
16:38,200 megapix sensor means you do get
16:40,options like the Samsung can shoot in 50
16:42,megapix mode although I still think the
16:44,iPhone's High reses 48 megapix mode is a
16:47,little better it retains the same
16:49,quality image processing as your normal
16:50,photos whereas for Samsung you actually
16:52,notice the quality of processing go down
16:54,you're kind of having to trade but then
16:56,Samsung also has a fullon 200 100
16:58,megapix mode which even though it takes
17:00,a long time to process the image is a
17:01,cool idea I love the concept of sitting
17:03,in front of a momentous landscape that I
17:05,know will be a once in a lifetime View
17:07,and deciding yeah this is where I go all
17:09,in on maximum resolution but I still
17:12,wouldn't necessarily say the 200
17:14,megapixel shots are better than the 50
17:16,megapix shots in the same way that you
17:18,notice the level of processing go down
17:19,as you go from 12 to 50 you notice it go
17:22,down again as you go from 50 to 200 to
17:24,the point where brighter parts of the
17:26,image for example might just now end up
17:28,Overexposed one of the new things for
17:30,Samsung is that they now allow you to
17:31,shoot photos in HDR where everything's
17:34,ultra bright and contrasty you'll be
17:35,able to see the preview in HDR while
17:37,you're taking the shots and then post
17:39,directly in HDR to social media like
17:41,Instagram
17:42,but me I mean I've kind of gone off the
17:45,idea of HDR there's actually so many
17:47,times where I'm purposefully trying to
17:49,keep my brightness low so that I can
17:51,properly sleep at night and in those
17:53,times HDR is actually pretty annoying I
17:55,turn it off whenever I can so it may be
17:57,a factor for you but it's not personally
17:59,ative for me so iPhone is going to take
18:02,it for average photo quality the only
18:04,exception to that is the ultra wide
18:06,cameras which I would say both phones
18:07,are pretty balanced with their well
18:09,matched 12 megapix sensors the iPhones
18:11,is a tiny bit wider and sometimes does
18:13,come out with more balanced colors but
18:15,also pretty often it feels like
18:16,Samsung's image processing has cleaned
18:18,up a scene better so that's one key
18:20,question answered what about video
18:23,Samsung made pretty big strides last
18:25,year with the s23 Ultras video I
18:26,remember taking that phone out for the
18:28,very first time and nodding my head like
18:30,a proud father as I noticed the
18:31,significant strides in noise reduction
18:33,the improved dynamic range and the
18:35,ability to shoot 8K video without it
18:37,sucking so where does the s20 force it
18:40,well I would say it's a refinement it's
18:42,a subtle neatening up an S 23.5 Ultra if
18:46,you will the level of noise is a tiny
18:48,bit further lowered the general
18:49,day-to-day stabilization a tiny bit
18:51,better thanks to the phone now using its
18:52,gyro sensors to better understand how
18:54,you're moving your phone and so what it
18:56,isn't is more detailed than the iPhone
18:58,when you're shooting really well-lit
19:00,shots during the day you can look at
19:02,both and think well they're basically
19:04,the same and even in a standard night
19:06,scene to be fair there's not a massive
19:07,amount in it which is absolutely awesome
19:09,to see but it's in the details when
19:11,you're cropping in close to a certain
19:13,part of a video or showing your family
19:14,or favorite Clips on a big TV the iPhone
19:17,has enough of a leading Clarity that you
19:19,probably would notice and that is a key
19:22,key factor and it's especially true when
19:24,you've got really challenging mix
19:25,lighting like this I like the fact that
19:27,when things are dark Samsung keeps them
19:29,dark but in these situations it's too
19:31,much it's like there's a black hole
19:33,under this tank that I've just
19:35,disappeared into or like Watch What
19:36,Happens as this tank passes in front of
19:38,us you see how it goes really dark for a
19:40,second yeah it's too much it makes it
19:42,feel like a less balanced camera than
19:44,the iPhone by the way yes that is
19:46,actually me driving the tank shout out
19:48,to Armageddon this place is absolutely
19:49,mental as for what happens when you try
19:51,and run after the tank as most same
19:54,people do the stabilization during video
19:57,is very much on car and very high tier
19:59,on both considering how much motion
20:01,there is but if you want to go all in on
20:03,stabilization with the phone's
20:05,respective super steady and action modes
20:07,well then the iPhone just runs away with
20:09,it literally I don't know what Apple did
20:11,when designing this feature but from the
20:13,moment they launched it no other phone
20:15,has overtaken them for their sheer
20:16,ability to take smooth and yet still
20:18,high resolution action scenes the only
20:21,final question on our minds then is
20:22,night photos which based on Samsung's
20:25,event is what they've paid particular
20:26,attention to and these two phones are
20:29,very good and very similar so much so
20:32,that when you're using light mode it's
20:34,in most situations as if you basically
20:36,got the exact same photo but just
20:38,processed it two different ways Samsung
20:40,with a cooler tone and lots of
20:41,sharpening applied apple with a warmer
20:43,tone and much less sharpening and one is
20:46,not really worse than the other I mean
20:48,Samsung absolutely slays the iPhone at
20:50,moon photos if that's your coverty the
20:51,iPhone has no idea what to do or which
20:54,camera to use but I also don't want to
20:56,overweight that cuz it's not a reg
20:58,regular thing you're going to be doing
20:59,and then the iPhone is slightly better
21:00,at night portraits just in the sense
21:02,that it manages to make them feel like
21:04,normal photos whereas the Samsung really
21:06,makes it look like it's using a special
21:08,mode and filter and also something that
21:09,we've been seeing in other parts of the
21:10,comparison too but that's particularly
21:12,noticeable at night the iPhone is better
21:14,able to deal with color like this shot
21:16,of me on the bench we took it like 15
21:18,different times as the bench cycled
21:20,through every single color and each time
21:22,the iPhone just got it the exposure was
21:24,better controlled and the colors much
21:26,more realistic to what we were seeing so
21:29,what does that leave us with well 6.5 to
21:32,Samsung 4.5 to the iPhone Samsung has
21:35,clawed back a lot this generation Less
21:37,in terms of the actual output getting
21:39,significantly better although there are
21:41,improvements there too the biggest thing
21:42,is the experience of taking photos the
21:45,much smoother camera app the much faster
21:46,shutter speed the highly Advanced new
21:48,editing tools and so even though this
21:49,doesn't mean that Samsung wins at
21:51,everything cuz the iPhone does win some
21:53,important
21:54,categories well I can't believe we're
21:56,actually doing this but a promisees a
21:59,promise on you go oh and if you're
22:01,enjoying this video then you sub to the
22:03,channel would be
22:05,wonderful right this tank is about to
22:08,fire a 100 mph highly explosive paint
22:10,grenade trust me you would not want to
22:12,get hit by one of these and now we just
22:14,shoot 3 2
22:20,1 did we kill it did we kill it did we
22:23,no we didn't phone is completely alive
22:26,and unmarked balls in your court for
22:29,next time
22:30,Apple
