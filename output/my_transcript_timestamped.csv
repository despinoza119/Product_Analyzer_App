0:00,six months ago I got the Apple watch
0:02,Ultra
0:03,it's got a picture of my dog on it plan
0:05,was to review it immediately decide that
0:07,it was still not even close to being
0:09,able to replace my Garmin a phoenix has
0:11,been with me across deserts over
0:13,mountains and throughout my fitness
0:15,journey it's quite simply unbeatable and
0:18,then send it back but this took me by
0:21,surprise and just three months later had
0:22,become my daily watch in my last video
0:25,on this I had to admit that apple had
0:26,finally produced a smart watch that was
0:29,of actual use for somebody other than
0:30,the odd person just wanting to make
0:32,contactless payments for their
0:33,plant-based wrap in Starbucks and then
0:35,check their step count for the day this
0:37,was of use to athletes so where does
0:40,that leave me today well much to the
0:42,light of all the Garmin Fanboys and the
0:45,disappointment of one or two vegans in
0:46,Starbucks I've changed my mind
0:48,[Music]
0:53,but not quite in the way you might think
0:55,when I made that last video three months
0:57,ago explaining that I now wore the Apple
0:59,all the time I made it very clear that
1:02,it was not the better sports watch this
1:04,is a Garmin Fenix 7x it is in my opinion
1:07,the best sports watch you can buy today
1:09,however it did do some things that the
1:11,Garmin simply could not do and those
1:13,things were important enough to me that
1:16,I forgave its weaknesses in other areas
1:18,it does the job but just in short it's
1:21,an iPhone on your wrist and that is
1:23,beneficial enough to me that I'll put up
1:25,with looking like a bit of a geek
1:27,wearing the thing now in that video I
1:29,also made it clear that the particular
1:30,requirements that I have for a watch may
1:33,be very different to yours and so while
1:35,the Apple watch perfect for me it might
1:37,be completely useless to you for example
1:40,some people said they couldn't think of
1:42,anything worse than going out for a run
1:44,and having your phone with you they
1:46,wanted that time to be undisturbed they
1:48,didn't want people to be able to get
1:50,hold of them
1:51,they wanted the bask in the Tranquility
1:53,of silence as they exercised I have a
1:56,whole bag of with your name on it
1:58,they're probably the sort of people that
2:00,take a daily cold plunge and do breath
2:02,work and that is fine it's not the watch
2:05,for them so what has changed for me well
2:07,not that much I still think the Garmin
2:10,is by far the better sports watch and I
2:12,think the Apple's ability to let me
2:14,leave my actual phone at home and go out
2:16,running with just this yet still have
2:19,telephone be able to get and send texts
2:21,stream music GPS it's all incredibly
2:24,useful so for example when I recently
2:26,ran across the Welsh mountains where a
2:29,mobile phone in your kit bag was a
2:30,requirement anyway and my watch needed
2:33,to be a foolproof tracking device no
2:35,question on with a Garmin but when I go
2:38,for my evening 10K jog around the block
2:40,with the dog and there's nothing more to
2:42,track than distance and time while
2:44,listening to a bit of Springsteen the
2:46,apple is perfect but what is different
2:48,now is that having had both watches I've
2:51,obviously focused a lot of attention on
2:52,what they do best and as I've explained
2:54,that's pretty clear-cut but I've also
2:56,spent quite a bit of time looking
2:57,looking at the extra features that they
2:59,both offer in order to try and see which
3:01,one does those better if I pick one of
3:04,these am I then going to be missing out
3:06,on something buried deep in the menu
3:07,options of the other that I can't live
3:10,without if I knew about it so I've
3:12,watched every 20 things you didn't know
3:14,about the Apple watch videos and 10
3:17,coolest features of the Garmin videos I
3:19,become expert in the tiny things that
3:21,set these apart from each other and I've
3:24,decided I just don't care when I'm
3:27,halfway up a hill and want to know how
3:30,much further to go because I can't see
3:32,because of the freezing fog the Garmin
3:34,will tell me and it will be accurate and
3:36,I like that and when I'm in the gym
3:38,doing 20 minutes on the rower and I want
3:41,to tell Siri to start playing the next
3:43,track once I've sent a text to Jen
3:45,saying I'll be home soon so stick on the
3:47,sauna the Apple's got it covered and I
3:49,like that but when it comes to which one
3:52,tells me that I got sufficient REM sleep
3:55,or my heart rate variability indicate so
3:58,I should be working out with extra
3:59,enthusiasm today or when my pulse ox
4:02,levels suggest whatever pulse ox levels
4:05,suggest
4:06,I'm just not interested I spent weeks
4:09,going through a bunch of different apps
4:10,on the Apple watch to try and replicate
4:12,the Garmin body battery features and I
4:14,got bogged down in the Garmin stamina
4:16,prediction settings and in the end I
4:18,just found myself thinking what are you
4:21,doing you're almost 50 years old did you
4:23,wake up feeling good yes do you feel
4:25,energetic yes do you have a spare hour
4:28,yes good go to the gym you don't need
4:30,permission from one of these first maybe
4:33,if I was a high level athlete wanting to
4:35,extract every last ounce of performance
4:37,I might be more inclined to pay in more
4:40,attention to such things but even then
4:42,here's a good example I've done a VO2
4:44,test in a laboratory hooked up to enough
4:46,Tech to send a man to the Moon I've also
4:49,had my VO2 max estimated by my almost
4:51,thousand pound Garmin over many hours of
4:54,it assessing my physiological metrics I
4:57,then ran around a track for 12 minutes
4:58,looked at my results on a chart invented
5:00,in 1955 and got the same number I didn't
5:03,need the tech and even then what is the
5:06,VO2 number that I did get tell me anyway
5:08,that for a big old lump I was quite
5:10,quick at running a relatively short
5:12,distance I know that here I am at my
5:14,local Duck Pond winning my age group
5:18,foreign
5:21,ER ducks in a 10k race with 500 meters
5:24,to go someone bigger and fatter than me
5:26,comes past all is not well there are
5:29,some things I just don't need technology
5:31,to help me work out interestingly I made
5:33,a video recently about how my dog who
5:36,doesn't wear any sports tracking device
5:37,because he's a dog he still loves going
5:40,for a run he doesn't track any metric
5:42,when he exercises he just runs and has a
5:44,lot of fun that video had a bunch of
5:46,people saying that they had also
5:47,abandoned their obsession with tracking
5:49,every last detail of their exercise and
5:52,we're just finding simple enjoyment in
5:54,the activity rather than the data they
5:56,called it naked running
5:58,hey honey I like the idea so much that
6:02,Jen and I are doing a run tomorrow just
6:04,like that the first time I will ever
6:06,have run a race without a watch on now
6:09,that is very unlikely to be my normal
6:10,approach to running in fact today I did
6:13,park run where I was aiming to get a
6:14,very specific time so I was watching my
6:17,watch intently but it will be nice to
6:19,know that I can just run data free
6:21,sometimes so what does that mean I do
6:23,now with regards picking between these
6:26,two and as I explain this I am aware I
6:29,am speaking as somebody that obviously
6:30,owns both devices so I will conclude by
6:33,picking just one my recommendation is
6:35,not going to be by both that said I use
6:39,both as I need to which actually means
6:41,that both of them spend most of their
6:43,time sat on charge now if I'm going for
6:45,a run around the block I'll grab the
6:47,Apple a short 10K probably the Garmin
6:50,medium distance probably the Apple real
6:52,long distance run where carrying a
6:54,telephone is normally part of the rules
6:56,anyway probably gonna go with the Garmin
6:58,again multiple different types of cardio
7:00,in the gym Apple watch with the work
7:02,Outdoors app that tracks all that
7:04,perfectly I love using it for that we're
7:06,going to meet mates in the pub probably
7:08,a Seiko that's a rough Pub G-Shock out
7:11,for dinner Amiga out for dinner
7:12,somewhere rough I don't go out for
7:14,dinner to places that are rough sat in
7:16,the house doing nothing buckle up no
7:18,watch there is nothing happening to my
7:21,body while watching Netflix and eating
7:22,chili Doritos with a homemade avocado
7:24,dip that I need to track with a watch
7:26,somebody asked me a good question the
7:28,other day how do I collate the data from
7:30,both so I'm currently using training
7:32,Peaks only for cardio somebody also
7:34,asked how I track my lifting workouts I
7:37,have a little notebook and I write stuff
7:38,down in that if I need to they said oh
7:41,don't use the rep counted feature on the
7:43,watches then no I don't do you know what
7:46,the rep counting feature on a watch is
7:48,like on my car if I move my fingers like
7:51,this in front of the stereo some camera
7:53,sensor thing turns the volume up or down
7:56,I think this mutes it and this turns it
7:59,up I don't know there is a button as
8:02,well though on off up down because your
8:06,Tech has a feature doesn't mean you need
8:09,to use the feature and I do understand
8:10,the temptation to use the feature when I
8:12,got the car I sat on the drive for an
8:14,hour learning all the hand signals I
8:17,look like Matthew Broderick and Project
8:18,X chatting with the chimps Google it
8:20,anyway back to cardio that I do track my
8:24,Apple watch sends results to training
8:26,Peaks my Garmin the same zwift on the
8:28,bike the same and I'm then currently
8:31,using exr on the rowing machine again
8:33,sends the data to training Peaks so all
8:36,my information is there and I have to
8:38,say it is liberating to not be tied to a
8:40,watch 24 7 for the first time in years
8:42,there's a tiny part of me that still
8:44,sees the appeal of one device being all
8:46,me 24 7 still especially when I put the
8:49,Garmin on and it pings up with
8:51,information about how my training is off
8:52,track or my Readiness state is low
8:54,because it doesn't know those things
8:56,because it's not with me most of the
8:58,time and momentarily I think would be
9:00,nice if it knew me better but I ignore
9:02,that I tell it I'm going for a run and I
9:04,get on with it so bottom line my
9:06,recommendation hasn't really changed
9:08,since the last video If you simply want
9:10,the best sports watch you can get no
9:13,question it is still the Garmin if you
9:15,need the telephone on your wrist
9:17,capabilities of a smart watch the Apple
9:20,watch Ultra is the best you can get for
9:22,that if I could only have one it would
9:25,still probably be the Apple simply
9:27,because there are so many things the
9:29,Apple can do that the Garment just can't
9:32,and they're things I use on a regular
9:34,almost daily basis in contrast the
9:37,Garmin definitely does some things
9:38,better than the apple looks like a
9:40,decent sports watch for one but those
9:43,are things that it is doing better than
9:44,the Apple they aren't necessarily things
9:46,the Apple can't do at all the only thing
9:48,the Garmin really does for me that the
9:51,app will just can't is Monitor and track
9:54,me on a long distance or extreme event
9:56,where the information is pretty Mission
9:58,critical if I'm doing any sort of event
10:00,lasting more than a few hours a 50k race
10:03,definitely a 100K Ultra I'm using the
10:06,Garmin I'm running a downloaded map on
10:08,it all the data I need right where I
10:10,want it and I know it will just work
10:12,the Apple might do it but it's starting
10:15,to get seriously out of its depth in my
10:17,opinion and if nothing else I don't want
10:18,to be 10 hours deep into a race I don't
10:20,have to start checking things like
10:21,battery life in fact if I only had the
10:24,apple and was doing a 100K race I'd
10:27,borrow a Garmin from somebody to do the
10:29,race so three months ago I said that it
10:33,was Apple for me 99 of the time but now
10:36,I have really settled on probably 50
10:38,Apple 20 Garmin the rest of the time a
10:42,regular watch or nothing at all as
10:45,always I reserve the right to change my
10:47,mind this channel is only ever about
10:49,what I am up to right now if in the
10:51,future a different bit of Kit will suit
10:52,my needs better or my needs change I'll
10:55,update you accordingly and to finish a
10:58,few people asked last time if I was paid
11:00,by Apple to stop wearing the Garmin the
11:03,answer is no get a grip I buy my watches
11:05,with my money and if I was creating a
11:07,video for Apple where I said as I did in
11:10,that last video I don't know who I'd
11:12,recommend this for four apart from
11:14,people that like coffee shops avocados
11:17,and counting their steps and me I'm not
11:19,sure they'd consider they got their
11:21,money's worth so no either way apple and
11:23,organ probably even know who I am
11:25,however if they are listening here's
11:27,what they could do to change how I use
11:29,their devices Garmin need to do whatever
11:32,needs to happen to make this thing
11:34,operate on the mobile phone network I
11:36,mean if they could do that just take my
11:38,money Apple I mean they've got somewhere
11:41,to go really they could just start off
11:43,by just making it look cooler I was at a
11:46,family meal recently I look around the
11:49,table and I realized that more than half
11:51,the people there had Apple watches on
11:53,these aren't athletes if there's a lot
11:55,of tracking their steps I'd be surprised
11:56,they're probably more excited about the
11:58,possibility of having a picture of their
12:00,Cocker shitsu on the screen saver than
12:02,anything else it's got a picture of my
12:04,dog on it if Apple could just make their
12:06,watch look actually sporty that would be
12:08,amazing I wanted to look at home on
12:10,Arnold's wrist not just Uncle Arnold's
12:14,wrist okay that is it I'm out of here
12:20,[Music]
