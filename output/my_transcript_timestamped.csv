0:00,well everyone it's time for us to go and
0:01,take a look at the Google pixel Watch 2
0:03,and compare it against the Apple Watch
0:05,series 9 and see which particular watch
0:07,is the better one for you now there are
0:09,lots and lots of advantages and
0:11,disadvantages between both of these
0:12,devices but I will tell you that there
0:15,isn't really one that's the better one
0:16,between both the biggest thing I've
0:18,always told people is that if you want
0:19,to go ahead and basically get a you know
0:21,watch for your Android phone you kind of
0:23,have to go with the Google pixel watch
0:25,or a Samsung Galaxy watch or one of
0:26,those if you have an iPhone really the
0:28,only option you have is a you know Apple
0:30,watch so keep that in mind if you want
0:32,to pick up either one of these devices
0:34,though links will be down in the
0:35,description you can get them from there
0:36,and you can UPS support the channel at
0:37,the same time now starting off with the
0:40,outside of both these watches the Apple
0:41,Watch series 9 is a really good watch
0:44,you know I love this watch a lot on the
0:45,outside of this watch you're getting it
0:47,in basically two different
0:48,specifications you're getting it either
0:50,in the 41 mm size or the 45 mm size
0:53,Within These so that's just one of those
0:56,things to keep in mind here if you're
0:57,somebody who wanted to go and buy you
0:59,know a watch for your iPhone like I
1:00,mentioned this is one of the options and
1:02,the size of this watch is very good I've
1:04,always loved it it you know it's not a
1:06,perfect watch by any means but it is a
1:08,different design than the Google pixel
1:09,watch which only comes out in one size
1:12,it only comes in that 41 mm size I am
1:15,okay with it like I think it's good and
1:16,everything but I do wish we kind of had
1:18,a bigger size or at least two different
1:19,options we can choose from whether it
1:21,was like the 40 and 44 or 41 and 45 I
1:23,wish there was another option out there
1:25,where we could go ahead and basically
1:27,you know have that Improvement there I
1:28,do think in the future you know Google's
1:30,probably going to do this I'm surprised
1:31,they still haven't done this yet but
1:33,that's just one of those things to kind
1:34,of keep in mind here from that
1:35,perspective as well now the design is
1:37,also different it's a circular design on
1:38,the pixel Watch 2 that's like another
1:40,small thing to kind of keep in mind
1:42,you're getting one button on the side
1:43,which allows you to just click on it on
1:44,the pixel Watch 2 on the Apple watch
1:46,you're getting two buttons the digital
1:48,crown and that side button very cool
1:50,stuff you know they kind of do the exact
1:52,same thing but it's still nice to have
1:53,that type of feature set on the back
1:55,side we basically have a wireless
1:56,charging pad so what we can do is we can
1:58,go ahead and plug this thing straight
1:59,into into a wireless charger and we can
2:01,go and charge up this specific you know
2:02,pixel watch just like that which is
2:04,honestly very very cool so once again
2:06,having the capability of just charging
2:07,up your watch is super awesome and
2:09,that's something once again that I look
2:11,at and I'm a big massive fan of as well
2:13,so from that specific standpoint I will
2:16,tell you from the outside both these
2:17,watches hold up very very well there's
2:19,not really a lot to complain about from
2:21,that specific perspective and I will
2:22,tell you from that you know standpoint
2:24,both these hold up very very well from
2:26,there which is super super cool now on
2:28,top of that I will tell you when it
2:30,comes down to the rest of these bodies
2:31,like I said I don't think there's one
2:32,that I'm like oh my goodness this is the
2:34,one that you have to pick up or anything
2:35,like that but they're both very solid I
2:37,will tell you the band structure between
2:39,both is something that's super cool I
2:40,love having those types of bands that
2:42,are kind of interchangeable in a way and
2:44,with these ones they hold up very very
2:46,well which I'm really really happy about
2:48,so once again from that perspective gets
2:49,a thumbs up for me as well now from this
2:51,type of watch another big thing to keep
2:53,in mind is the pricing the pixel Watch 2
2:55,is $350 the Apple Watch series 9
2:58,basically starts at $3.99 now the cell
3:00,models and everything kind of change in
3:02,price for the Apple watches but there's
3:03,about a $50 difference between the two
3:05,between the two bottom tier models again
3:08,again just kind of depends on which one
3:09,you want now when it comes down to the
3:11,features inside I don't really know if
3:13,there's one particular watch that I
3:14,would look at as it having the most
3:16,amount of features between these two I
3:18,feel like both these are within their
3:20,own realm like they're kind of in their
3:21,own worlds because Android iOS you know
3:23,they kind of have their own features but
3:25,at their core they do almost the exact
3:27,same type of things so if you're wanting
3:29,to go ahead and get a watch like I said
3:31,these two watches are going to beic be
3:32,doing the exact same thing between them
3:35,which again is super cool if you're
3:36,wanted to go ahead and have your high
3:37,and low heart rate notifications if you
3:39,want the ECG apps if you want the you
3:41,know all this other stuff you can do it
3:43,I will say with the pixel watch it does
3:45,look like you do have that interesting
3:46,thing which is basically the skin
3:48,temperature sensing and a lot more
3:51,stress focused sensing which is really
3:53,cool I don't know I don't think the
3:55,Apple watch has stuff like that it kind
3:56,of does it a little bit but that is
3:58,something that's kind of interesting
3:59,resting on the pixel watch but beyond
4:01,that from what I would do on an everyday
4:03,basis between my watches these two
4:05,watches basically be able to handle
4:07,everything I would be able to do because
4:08,most of the time what I'm doing like I
4:09,mentioned before I'm just basically
4:11,checking my notifications and very
4:13,rarely am I ever doing anything else
4:15,maybe I'm tracking a workout here and
4:16,there or maybe I'm doing something else
4:17,like that but the majority of the time
4:19,and the majority of things that I'm
4:20,doing it's usually very very basic stuff
4:22,so what I would tell you is with both
4:24,these watches they are very solid
4:26,options I like these watches a lot but I
4:28,will probably tell you if if you're
4:29,wanting to go ahead and buy the better
4:31,watch for you it really comes down to
4:33,are you on Android or iOS if you're on
4:35,Android go for the pixel watch if you're
4:36,on iPhone or iOS go for the Apple watch
4:38,and that's kind of the best way I can
4:40,kind of describe it so that pretty much
4:42,covers it up there if you have any other
4:43,thoughts or questions let me know in the
4:45,comment section below hit the like
4:46,button that me so much but definitely
4:48,hit that subscribe button more
4:49,importantly than everything else I love
4:50,every single one of you guys hopefully
4:52,I'll catch you guys in the next video
4:53,peace that's all
4:58,then
