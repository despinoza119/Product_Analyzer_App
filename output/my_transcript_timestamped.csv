0:00,"If you are looking for a new top of the range,"
0:02,you probably want to know which of these two is the best.
0:05,So in less than five minutes I'll tell you
0:07,"and I want to start by talking about the iPhone 14, which has changed its design a little bit this year"
0:12,to incorporate this new notch that does some really cool things
0:17,interacting with the content of some applications.
0:20,But after a while you kind of forget that it's there too at last.
0:24,"And they added the display always on, which is a little bit different"
0:28,"to the one we have in Android, but otherwise it's the same as always,"
0:33,although with cameras a little more striking.
0:36,I have the smaller version and if you are looking for a compact mobile
0:40,"and with an excellent battery, this is possibly the best on the market."
0:45,"But let's be honest, if you're thinking about buying an iPhone"
0:48,"it's probably because of its system,"
0:50,"which is still a delight to delight to use, especially after"
0:54,of solving some bugs that it came with at launch.
0:57,"But in terms of performance and usability,"
0:59,it's a phone that will last you a few years
1:02,and also when it comes to playing games you won't have any problem.
1:06,"In addition to this, one of the reasons why you use an iPhone"
1:09,as a content creator is because of its better compatibility
1:12,"with some video applications, such as Instagram or Static."
1:17,On the left you have a video uploaded with the s 23 ultra
1:20,and on the right with the iPhone and I believe that it is possible to see the difference in quality.
1:26,"Now, when you buy an iPhone you also you become a prisoner of its ecosystem,"
1:30,"since the best accessories are the ones from Apple,"
1:33,"such as the Apple Watch, the iPods Pro and in computers the Macs."
1:39,"It's true that you can use Windows and other accessories, but let's say that"
1:43,you will find some limitations like the ones I have found
1:47,when trying to transfer some videos and pictures to Windows ten pulling.
1:51,This is a very complete equipment and one that will hardly let you down.
1:55,It has an excellent screen.
1:56,"I love your speakers, they're great too."
1:59,The connectivity is good and you know it will last you a long time.
2:03,Thanks to its good update policy.
2:09,Already with the Galaxy I would say that things are a bit
2:11,"more fun, with an overall design that's much more much more innovative and attractive."
2:16,"In my opinion, its curved screen on the sides"
2:19,is a luxury to use your system is more open and will allow you to install
2:23,"third-party applications easily, as well as other as well as other little things that we don't find"
2:29,"on the iPhone, like the in-display fingerprint reader in-screen fingerprint reader or even the embedded stylus."
2:33,It is true that its design
2:34,"does not represent a great evolution, but much less does the iPhone"
2:38,and in terms of performance it is no longer behind.
2:41,Thanks to the new Snapdragon eight Generation Two
2:44,"and its storage ufff, that 4K zero that when you use it"
2:48,"in day to day tasks like this, you repeat what you're seeing."
2:52,It's just fast and with which you also won't have
2:55,to worry about the deal.
2:57,Its performance is brutal
2:58,and one of the best things that came with this processor
3:01,"has been the power optimization, which means it will last you a long time"
3:05,"longer and in my opinion, it gets to be better than the iPhone"
3:08,by the simple fact of being compatible with charging up to 45 watts.
3:13,"Regarding the Windows system, I believe it ends up"
3:16,"being a matter of taste, but if everything works in a way"
3:20,"smooth, fast and trouble-free and with various customizations."
3:25,"Man, I see it well."
3:26,"Now, we have to talk about the camera section."
3:29,"Yes, I'm a little bit divided here because neither one of them is my favorite."
3:33,The Samsung is better in terms of color rendition
3:37,"and the anvil has makes it more versatile, but on many occasions"
3:41,"it tends to overexpose the scene, whereas the iPhone"
3:44,"is a bit more constant,"
3:46,"but the change of tonality in some colors bothers me,"
3:50,although when we get to video mode I have to give the advantage to the iPhone
3:54,for the simple fact of being a little better with HDR and against the light.
3:59,"I know I'm not being very detailed about the cameras, but you can see"
4:02,this comparison where I go a little more in depth.
4:05,"Having said all this, I think at the end of the day"
4:07,"it all depends on what you need and the ecosystem you prefer,"
4:11,"but if you had to choose one, which one would it be?"
4:15,Leave your opinion in the comments.
4:16,If you want to get into the world of Apple and you don't mind buying their accessories
4:21,"to get the most out of your iPhone, then go ahead."
4:25,It's a good device and your gadgets are also very good.
4:28,"Otherwise, if like me you use"
4:30,"Windows, you like a more open system more open system where you can customize,"
4:35,"install third party applications, then the Samsung is the best choice."
4:39,With both mobiles you will be satisfied and better because they cost more than 1.000 â‚¬.
4:43,and for this price they should be almost perfect and in a way they are.
4:48,"And as I told you at the beginning, this video was going to last less"
4:51,"than five minutes, so I'll say goodbye and I'll see you in the next one."
4:55,"Bye, bye."
