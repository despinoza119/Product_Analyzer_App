0:00,Apple versus Samsung the ultimate battle
0:03,between Tech they've been Rivals for as
0:04,long as I can remember so today we're
0:06,going to be putting all of their newest
0:08,products head-to head to find out once
0:10,and for all which is better this will be
0:12,a Fair competition we will be judging
0:13,based off quality performance camera
0:15,quality battery life and of course the
0:17,price May the best company win the
0:20,tablets now I'm a bit biased as we all
0:22,know based on my channel I use a lot of
0:23,Apple product but I'm going to be fair
0:25,and square today satisfying ability
0:28,Apple wins same exact
0:30,no this one was easier to pull first
0:32,thing we're comparing is the iPad 10th
0:34,Generation versus the Galaxy Tab S9 Fe
0:38,and that name is Long Galaxy Tab F9 e
0:41,srn the Galaxy Tab s9f comes in at
0:45,$379 whilst the Apple iPad comes in at
0:49,$449 so not too big of a difference but
0:51,apple is definitely more expensive right
0:53,now Moment of Truth oh my goodness this
0:55,is so
0:56,[Music]
0:58,cool am I dumb this is why I'm Apple
1:01,user I don't know what I'm is it just me
1:02,or do it not open this is why you need
1:04,the arrows I do need the arrows okay so
1:06,here is our galaxy tab ooh this is clean
1:09,not going to lie it feels really nice
1:11,and this is the key difference right
1:12,here this little thing right here the
1:14,pen is probably going to be the reason
1:15,why this went because if you were to get
1:17,the apple pencil it would be an extra
1:18,$100 inside the Samsung tablet we have
1:20,charger and then I guess the
1:22,instructions is there anything else in
1:23,the Box no then over here on the iPad
1:26,ooh she's nice she's pretty and then
1:29,inside the Apple box we have a block and
1:31,a braided charger which is sick because
1:33,the other one wasn't braided okay so
1:34,we're pretty even Steven right about now
1:36,but let's turn them on dude I feel like
1:38,it's such a I feel like such a dummy
1:40,when it comes to like Samsungs cuz I
1:41,really don't know how to function these
1:43,things not going to lie oh see the
1:44,Apple's already on it's already on and
1:46,ready this one took forever oh okay all
1:49,right so I'm going to go ahead and Skip
1:51,through the boring part and start both
1:52,of these up okay so I have both of them
1:54,on and ready to go to be honest right
1:56,off the B the apple is so much more
1:57,colorful I know that's not even good
1:59,comparison but this looks way better but
2:00,this pen is so fun look watch
2:02,[Music]
2:05,this this pretty cool I think go first
2:09,things first I'm the realest oh shoot I
2:12,just looked up the battery life on both
2:13,of these the iPad is a 10 hour straight
2:16,and I was like wow that's really good
2:18,Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 20 hours they said
2:21,doubly I'm going to have to give it to
2:22,Samsung Point Samsung oh and then the
2:24,price Samsung wins too oh Samsung is
2:26,winning so much right now this freaking
2:28,crazy let's do video quality I think
2:31,it's very important to test out how good
2:33,the video watching looks because let's
2:34,all be so for real we're all watching
2:36,Sil G right now 160 dude I'm actually
2:39,really liking this right now to be
2:40,honest so are you going to switch to
2:41,Samsung no what this is for science this
2:44,is not for me this is for science time
2:46,to do the video test I'm so excited well
2:48,this is so freaking hard dude this is
2:49,impossible I'm like oh let me just
2:51,compare them it'll be so easy apple
2:53,apple apple apple I don't want all the
2:55,comments being like she just picked
2:56,Apple because she just likes it better
2:59,I'm being fair and square for video
3:01,playback I'm going to have to give it to
3:03,Samsung I don't know why I feel like it
3:05,just looks like better coloring better
3:06,quality I mean of course it's really
3:08,hard to tell based off a YouTube video
3:10,but just based on watching it back I
3:11,think the Samsung wi now it's time to
3:13,test out the performance and what better
3:14,way to test out the performance of a
3:16,device then you ain't ready for this one
3:18,I'll give you a
3:21,hint yeah not going to lie we open this
3:23,at 100% or like 95% it's at 87 already
3:26,iPads die fast they look so similar it's
3:28,not even funny like they just both look
3:30,good there's no complaints with either
3:32,of these I guess they make good devices
3:34,huh I can't do both at the same time
3:37,impressive thank you using my
3:39,multitasking
3:42,skills based on performance I feel like
3:44,it's just a tie there's absolutely no
3:46,way we can tell performance the tablet
3:48,battle based on everything the Samsung
3:50,tablet wins it's overall cheaper better
3:53,and it comes with the pen I feel bad
3:54,betraying out next thing up we're going
3:56,to try out the Galaxy buds 2 Pro versus
3:59,the airpod tube there's no sticker to
4:03,pull than Galaxy buds 2
4:07,Pro yeah so this is obviously not the
4:09,original Apple packaging whoops but we
4:11,have of course the charger and the
4:13,airpods and then over here we have the
4:15,Samsung 2 buds BR Galaxy buds 2 Pro the
4:20,biggest way we're going to compare these
4:21,is really just how good they sound and
4:23,the battery both of these earbuds are
4:25,priced at the exact same amount of
4:27,$179 so that is a tie the airpods third
4:30,generation battery life lasts 6 hours
4:33,without the charging case and the Galaxy
4:35,buds 2 Pro lasts 8 hours whatever so now
4:38,it's time but the only thing that's
4:39,actually important all right just the
4:41,ear budge I like the look of the airpods
4:43,better to be honest they're easier to
4:44,put on too cuz they have like a little
4:45,handle bro my
4:49,favorite okay our little jelly beans
4:52,going
4:53,in these sound better these are
4:55,definitely louder but these definitely I
4:57,can hear like every little like beat and
4:59,rum and sound from the studio that was
5:02,made this masterpiece this is one of the
5:04,most difficult decisions I've ever had
5:05,to make after a further dilemma and
5:07,debate the fact that this lasts longer
5:09,in the battery and just the overall I
5:11,feel like these are easier to use though
5:12,like I'm not saying that these are
5:13,better in every way I'm just saying that
5:15,they sound better and they last longer
5:16,but these are like still my favorite cuz
5:18,they pair very easily and they're easier
5:19,to use just based off of the fact yxy
5:22,wins again bro this is rigged this is
5:25,freaking rigged honestly I'm so sad like
5:26,I feel like this is not right this is
5:28,not how it's supposed to go the moment
5:30,you guys have been waiting for the
5:31,ultimate battle the iPhone 15 Pro Max
5:35,and the Galaxy s24 Ultra these are both
5:38,in the new titanium color the Galaxy s24
5:40,Ultra is actually starting at
5:42,"$1,400 versus Apple's $1,200 for the"
5:45,first time in history I think Samsung's
5:47,actually more
5:49,expensive you see that you see how
5:51,unsatisfying that freaking tear was
5:55,ridiculous now this is crazy this has to
5:59,be the most ultimate showdown of all
6:01,time look at it so the battery for video
6:05,watchback for the Galaxy is 30 hours
6:08,versus the iPhone which is 29 hours so
6:10,again not a huge difference not a big
6:11,deal I just think it's so funny that
6:13,both of the companies came up with a
6:14,titanium color at the same time inside
6:17,the Apple box of course we have the
6:18,instructions Apple stickers and the
6:21,braided cable charger inside the Samsung
6:23,box the charger instructions I don't
6:25,think the internet is ready for this not
6:26,satisfying wait just wait for it
6:32,wow I tried okay wow look at that you
6:35,should not be in the same room together
6:37,this kind of crazy okay I feel like
6:39,apple screen is obviously way better
6:41,this is just being nitpicky but like I
6:42,want to be welcomed with hello colors
6:44,just a blank white welcome screen okay
6:47,so we're into both of our smartphones
6:49,the Galaxy and the iPhone and this is
6:51,what we're looking like so far I have to
6:53,say I'm not used to like a Galaxy
6:55,Samsung feel whatsoever I think the look
6:58,of both of them are super cool it looks
7:00,like it would poke your eye out yeah it
7:01,is pretty sharp I'm not going to lie
7:02,just holding it like there's like very
7:04,pointy edges and it's not like that
7:05,comfortable for me to hold check this
7:07,out guys yall are ready for
7:09,this a pen I don't know why I love the
7:12,pen so much dude it's like when I had a
7:13,DS I just love that they always
7:16,incorporate the pen for some reason who
7:17,wouldn't want a littleit a pen right now
7:19,Samsung wins just for this little thing
7:21,of course now we have to test the
7:22,biggest thing with the two different
7:24,smartphones the cameras everything else
7:26,is pretty similar but the cameras is the
7:28,biggest deal to me cuz I SP the most
7:29,time using the camera on my phone okay
7:32,let's see ooh that's close that is close
7:36,I can't tell which one looks better I
7:37,think I look less crusty in the Apple
7:38,One M Samsung's is definitely more like
7:41,contrast and like more sharp this is the
7:44,camera test on both of the phones what
7:46,are we thinking which one looks better
7:49,right now apple looks like it's winning
7:51,dang you guys are going to have to
7:52,comment down below which one you think
7:53,looks better because I really can't tell
7:55,like I feel like both of them look great
7:57,just in different ways I have no idea I
7:59,think we're going to have to take this
8:00,camera test up a level and go outside
8:02,all right oh my gosh this is crazy I
8:06,think we have a obvious winner right now
8:08,after just looking at this footage I
8:10,think the Samsung is having a really
8:12,hard time picking up all this Apple's
8:14,looking way crispier right now I can't
8:16,tell time to see the final verdict on
8:18,the camera oh man this is tough it's so
8:22,close they look so similar it's honestly
8:24,crazy I feel like each of them do better
8:26,under certain lightings dude I think
8:28,Apple wins am I biased apples just
8:31,always been better at cameras though
8:32,that's just how it is that's how it be
8:34,no that's crazy that's hard to tell
8:35,right look better though you think so
8:38,yeah okay
8:40,Samsung I don't know I feel like it has
8:42,to put Apple just cuz I think so huh bro
8:46,they're just like coping each other at
8:47,this point although look at when you
8:49,turn on the Galaxy that one's kind of
8:51,cooler and of course we have to test out
8:52,the speakers to see which one has a
8:54,better overall sound I'm not super
8:56,professional with all of this so don't
8:57,go hate on me in the comments being like
8:59,oh my God she doesn't even know what
9:00,she's talking about I'm just judging
9:02,based on my own personal opinion okay so
9:03,calm down of course our favorite
9:04,non-copyright
9:08,sounds dude they sound the exact
9:12,same the overall feel of this one my
9:15,hand though is kind of annoying this
9:16,one's way easier to hold I do feel that
9:18,the screen is bigger than this one just
9:19,because it's a square overall these are
9:21,very very close devices they're both
9:23,really really awesome both really really
9:25,expensive based on the overall price
9:28,battery for performance and quality the
9:30,winner of the smartphone Awards in the
9:32,sah Grace book of world record it is an
9:34,official book the iPhone 15 Pro Max now
9:37,you can argue with me on the comments I
9:38,get it Samsung has its very own perks
9:40,and benefits but overall just the user
9:42,friendliness of the iPhone and the
9:44,camera most importantly which is the
9:45,most important thing to me iPhone wins
9:47,it and for the price you're charging us
9:49,$200 extra for the pen next up is the
9:52,watch category we have the Galaxy watch
9:55,6 versus the Apple watch 9 45 mm so this
9:58,is the newest watch of each starting off
10:00,with the price the Galaxy watch 6 comes
10:02,in at $339 while the Apple watch comes
10:04,in at
10:06,$399 so it's about $50 more expensive
10:08,which is not too shabby I obviously am
10:10,an Apple watch user so I'm going to try
10:12,my best not to be biased packaging let's
10:14,just be so for real Apple wins every
10:16,time like come on now come on come on
10:18,that's an experience this is like Oh yay
10:20,I got my new my new Samsung watch this
10:23,is Magic I feel like apple is just like
10:25,when you open their products it's just
10:26,an experience like everybody knows it
10:28,like when you get a new Apple product
10:29,you peel it open for the first time it's
10:30,just
10:32,like so here is the new Apple watch
10:35,series 9 I have not even seen this
10:37,before so I'm excited and then we have
10:39,the Apple watch band all right so here
10:42,are the two watches I don't really know
10:44,how to turn this one on dude both of
10:45,these suck so far neither of them have
10:47,battery okay so both of them popped up
10:48,pretty quickly let's go ahead and set
10:50,them up personally I like the Galaxy
10:53,look better just because it looks more
10:54,like your classic watch and doesn't look
10:56,super like it doesn't stand out as much
10:57,as the Apple watch does see look how
10:59,much quicker that was your Apple watch
11:01,is paired why does it need to download a
11:02,software call me impatient if you want
11:04,but I'm impatient honestly this is going
11:06,to be the TA tail sign whichever one
11:07,Finish First
11:11,wins the Samsung actually beat the Apple
11:15,so the watch is now paired I feel like
11:17,this is going to have to be one of the
11:18,hardest comparisons because how the heck
11:19,do you compare a watch like I feel like
11:21,it's definitely personal preference on
11:23,like what style you like better okay so
11:25,now that I have the watch on this thing
11:26,is actually huge I don't know if I'm
11:29,meant to get the screen this big or if
11:30,they even make smaller ones but it does
11:32,look a little silly goofy yo it's a
11:33,little laggy daily activity run walking
11:36,cycling basic stuff sleep tracker body
11:39,composition what the heck or fat I know
11:41,it's going to tell me if I'm I have
11:42,no idea how accurate this this thing is
11:44,36% body fat there are legit whole
11:47,machine don't put my body fat percentage
11:48,on there it's
11:50,embarrassing body get this
11:55,off you're not
11:57,fat bad I swear to you there are like
12:01,whole machines for this kind of stuff
12:03,there's absolutely no way a watch could
12:05,do that sleep weather calendar okay what
12:08,is this Samsung be so freaking for real
12:10,what is this what is this that looks
12:11,like it's going to haunt me in my dream
12:14,terrifying I look like I got run over my
12:17,four C it's been a long day
12:22,bro Samsung just called me fat and ugly
12:25,in so many different ways oh well it
12:27,does kind of look like me no
12:29,ah samung you have questionable tastes
12:32,you have questionable tastes to say the
12:34,least okay so this is what the Apple
12:35,watch looks like and personally I like
12:37,this layout better cuz I'm familiar with
12:40,it but it also is just more bright and
12:41,colorful but this one doesn't have a
12:43,freaking body composition like that
12:45,other one that was cool they all have
12:46,pretty much the same thing which is like
12:47,the ability to text from it call from it
12:49,I know I may be a little biased but I do
12:51,think that the Apple watch faces are way
12:54,better they're just like cleaner and
12:55,more like modern I mean look we got
12:57,mickeey Mouse right here come on now I
12:58,think these are just cool cuz they have
13:00,all this information on the screen more
13:01,practical exactly they're practical
13:04,they're boring honestly this has to be
13:06,one of the hardest comparison we did
13:08,today just because they're so similar
13:10,they do relatively the same thing and
13:12,the prices were so similar honestly I
13:15,feel like this comparison is based
13:16,personally on just personal opinion and
13:19,preference that's my opinion for this
13:21,one going to have to go to the abat and
13:24,after going through every single device
13:26,and dividing up points for whichever win
13:28,the win of the Apple versus Samsung
13:30,competition with the Samsung tablet
13:33,winning that's one point Samsung the
13:35,Galaxy Budz is another point for Samsung
13:37,the smartphone is a win for apple and
13:39,the watches is a win for Apple so the
13:42,grand total of who has a better
13:44,ecosystem is a tie I guess we'll just
13:46,have to leave it up to the comment
13:51,section
