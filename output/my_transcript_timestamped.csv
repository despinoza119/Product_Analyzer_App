0:00,hey what's up guys will here for GSM
0:02,Arina every year we get a new vanilla
0:05,iPhone and this time around you might
0:07,wonder if it's worth upgrading to the
0:08,freshest model the iPhone 15 of course
0:12,if you went for last year's iPhone 14
0:14,instead you'd save some cash but miss
0:16,out on a few new features as well is
0:19,there enough of a difference to make the
0:21,iPhone 15 worth getting over the 14
0:23,let's put them head-to-head and find
0:27,[Music]
0:28,out
0:30,this year's new iPhone generation brings
0:32,a few upgrades over the previous one
0:34,even at the level of the base model one
0:37,of the most significant is the move from
0:39,lightning to USBC connectivity another
0:42,major change is that the iPhone 15 has a
0:44,pill-shaped cutout on the front rather
0:46,than the notch cutout you get on the
0:48,iPhone
0:49,14 from the backside though you'd be
0:51,hard pressed to tell the two phones
0:53,apart the iPhone 15 and iPhone 14 have
0:56,the same size and shape there is a
0:59,slight difference in that on the new
1:00,model the edge of the aluminum frame is
1:02,more
1:03,rounded of course both phones bring the
1:06,same ip68 rated ingress protection
1:08,against dust and water submersion the
1:11,iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 both have a 6.1
1:14,in OLED display with ceramic Shield
1:16,protection and just a 60 HZ refresh rate
1:20,there are a couple of major changes on
1:21,the new model though the first is the
1:23,pill cutout which I already mentioned
1:25,and it comes with a dynamic Island
1:27,functionality for extra information and
1:29,shortcuts
1:30,the other change is that the iPhone 15
1:32,can boost its brightness when it needs
1:33,to in auto brightness mode we saw it Max
1:36,"outed nearly 1, 1650 nits versus a"
1:39,little over 800 on the iPhone 14 this
1:42,could come in handy on a sunny day
1:45,Outdoors other than that both phones
1:47,displays perform in a similar fashion
1:49,and have support for hdr10 and Dolby
1:51,Vision there's another difference when
1:53,it comes to these iPhone stereo speakers
1:56,the older model is slightly louder you
1:58,can listen and compare the audio quality
1:59,quality for yourself with the provided
2:02,link as you'd expect you get basically
2:04,the same software experience on either
2:06,phone as they both run Apple's latest
2:09,IOS
2:10,17 however since the iPhone 14 is a year
2:13,older its software support won't last
2:15,quite as long as the iPhone 15s another
2:18,difference is that since the iPhone 15
2:20,generation has USBC connectivity you can
2:23,connect the new iPhones to an external
2:25,display via USBC alt
2:27,mode and through USBC host post mode you
2:30,can connect the iPhone 15 to peripherals
2:32,like a mouse keyboard or external USB
2:35,storage let's talk about the chipset the
2:37,iPhone 14 runs on Apple's a15 bionic
2:40,which was cutting edge two generations
2:42,ago in contrast the iPhone 15 has an a16
2:46,bionic which was found in last year's
2:48,Pro Models while both are quite powerful
2:51,the newer chipset is a bit better the
2:53,a16 bionic has support for more advanced
2:55,lpddr 5x RAM and is able to provide
2:58,about a 15% Improvement in overall
3:01,performance the iPhone 15 has a slightly
3:04,larger battery than the iPhone 14 and
3:06,the battery life itself is a little
3:08,better too the iPhone 15 scored an
3:10,overall endurance rating of 98 hours in
3:12,our tests compared to 90 hours on the
3:15,iPhone 14 screen on tasks saw the most
3:18,Improvement when it comes to charging
3:20,speed with a proper 20 W adapter we were
3:23,able to charge the iPhone 14 to 60% in
3:25,half an hour and the iPhone 15 charged
3:28,to 58% in the same amount of time about
3:30,the same but a full charge was faster on
3:34,the older model it took an hour and 31
3:36,minutes versus an hour and 50 minutes on
3:38,the iPhone
3:39,15 and now for the cameras the iPhone 14
3:43,has a 12 megap main Cam and a 12 megapix
3:46,Ultra wide cam meanwhile the iPhone 15
3:49,brings a new 48 megapix Main cam also
3:52,paired with a 12 megapixel Ultra wide
3:55,When comparing photos from the main
3:57,cameras you get about the same rendition
3:59,from both phones with Apple's signature
4:01,look but the iPhone 15's main camera
4:04,produces 24 mapel photos by default and
4:07,they have more fine detail than the
4:08,iPhone 14's 12 megapix
4:12,photos the two times digital zoomed
4:14,photos from the iPhone 15 also look
4:16,better than the iPhone 14s because it
4:18,has a lot more resolution to work
4:21,with both phones have great low light
4:23,capture with their main cams but the
4:25,iPhone 15 has a slight
4:28,Edge photos from the ultra wide cam
4:31,aren't too impressive on either phone
4:33,but the contrast and colors do match
4:35,those of the main
4:37,camera and finally the video capture is
4:40,excellent from both the iPhone 14 and
4:42,the iPhone 15 you can record in up to 4K
4:46,with any of the cameras with great
4:50,stabilization so there you have it guys
4:53,the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 15 so which
4:56,is better the answer isn't so clear-cut
4:59,the iPhone iPhone 15 brings a brighter
5:00,display the modern looking Dynamic
5:02,Island the slightly better chipset
5:04,performance and battery life and more
5:06,detailed photos out of the main cam
5:08,meanwhile the iPhone 14 has louder
5:11,speakers and more importantly the lower
5:14,price another factor to consider is
5:16,lightning versus USBC it's nice to have
5:19,the more Universal USB standard but if
5:22,you're coming from another iPhone or
5:23,everyone in your family is using
5:25,lightning then USBC won't have much of a
5:27,benefit for you in the end the the
5:29,iPhone 15 has a slight Edge when it
5:31,comes to the features but if you want to
5:33,save some cash the iPhone 14 won't
5:35,disappoint either thanks for watching
5:37,and see you on the next
5:50,one
