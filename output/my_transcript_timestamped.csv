0:05,next-gen consoles are right around the
0:06,corner and excitement for the ps5 and
0:08,xbox series x is heating up with every
0:10,passing day
0:12,and there really is plenty of reason to
0:13,be excited the two new consoles both
0:15,represent
0:16,significant jumps over their
0:17,predecessors in more ways than one and
0:19,it's fun to think about the potential
0:20,leaps we'll see in games because of that
0:22,in this feature we're going to talk
0:24,about the 15 biggest ways the ps5
0:26,differs from the ps4
0:28,and the ps4 pro from specs to aesthetic
0:30,changes
0:31,and more ssd
0:35,let's start with what is potentially the
0:37,biggest change of them all
0:38,shall we the fact that consoles are now
0:40,going to have solid state drives is
0:42,exciting in and of itself
0:44,but the ps5 is looking to blow all
0:45,competition out of the water with its
0:47,ssd
0:49,bar none this is the fastest ssd on the
0:51,market right now
0:52,and while we're obviously excited about
0:54,how it will more or less eliminate load
0:56,times
0:56,what's even more exciting is the
0:58,advancements it will enable in
1:00,actual game design for now it's all
1:02,theoretical but hopefully we won't have
1:04,to wait long before developers start
1:05,leveraging the ps5
1:06,ssd properly
1:10,cpu and gpu the ps5 is significantly
1:13,more powerful than the ps4 and ps4 pro
1:16,in other ways as well
1:17,back in 2013 the ps4's eight core 1.6
1:20,gigahertz jaguar cpu
1:22,was already outdated and though the ps4
1:25,pro's 2.1 gigahertz 8 core
1:27,jaguar processor was an improvement it
1:29,was still far from cutting edge
1:31,now the ps5 semi-custom zen 2 cpu still
1:35,isn't cutting edge per se but it's a
1:37,huge improvement
1:38,then there's the gpu which is an even
1:40,bigger jump at 10.28 t
1:42,flops as compared to the ps4 1.84
1:45,t-flops
1:45,and the ps4 pros 4.2 t-flops
1:50,tempest engine one of the most
1:52,interesting aspects of the ps5 hardware
1:54,that sony have talked about
1:56,is the tempest the console's 3d audio
1:59,engine
1:59,it's interesting because it's finally
2:01,focusing on an aspect that is so often
2:03,left by the wayside by console hardware
2:06,there is a lot of potential here to
2:07,increase immersion and heightened
2:09,atmosphere in games
2:11,and while we're yet to see how or if it
2:13,will make an actual difference
2:14,we're hoping that it won't be long
2:16,before that becomes clear
2:19,ray tracing while pc gaming has been
2:22,reaping the benefits of ray tracing for
2:23,a while now
2:24,consoles have been lagging behind in
2:26,that area
2:27,now however they're finally going to
2:29,catch up unlike its predecessors the ps5
2:32,is capable of hardware
2:33,accelerated ray tracing which given the
2:36,industry's constant drive to make games
2:38,look better
2:38,and more photorealistic is a huge deal
2:42,8k capable 4k has become more common
2:46,over these past few years in the console
2:48,space thanks to the ps4 pro
2:50,and the xbox one x the latter especially
2:53,and hopefully it will become the
2:54,industry standard in the coming years
2:56,curiously enough though sony have said
2:59,that the ps5 is
3:00,also capable of rendering 8k resolutions
3:02,for games
3:04,now we don't know how true that is
3:05,hardware manufacturers
3:07,often say things about upcoming consoles
3:09,that might be true on paper but are much
3:11,harder to actually pull off
3:13,which means that though the ps5 might
3:14,conceivably be capable of 8k
3:16,there's a chance that we won't ever see
3:18,that come to light
3:19,we hope it happens though but we do know
3:21,there are no guarantees
3:24,new color scheme for nearly two decades
3:27,black has been the color of playstation
3:29,that's not to say playstation consoles
3:31,are only ever available in black but
3:33,black has been the primary flagship
3:35,color
3:36,of the ps2 the ps3 and the ps4 hell even
3:38,the psp and ps vita
3:40,the ps5 is unique because it's breaking
3:43,away from that tradition and going with
3:44,white
3:45,being its flagship color theme
3:48,no more dual shock since 1997 the dual
3:52,shock has been synonymous with the
3:53,playstation brand
3:55,and though sony did try and fail to do
3:57,something different with the ps3 6-axis
3:59,they'll be hoping that their second
4:01,attempt to leave dualshock behind will
4:03,be more successful
4:04,visually the dual sense obviously has a
4:06,lot of similarities to dualshock 4
4:08,but its innards have some interesting
4:10,new things going on so let's talk about
4:12,those for a bit
4:15,adaptive triggers one of the biggest new
4:17,features being introduced with the dual
4:19,sense that the dualshock 4 did not have
4:21,is adaptive triggers
4:23,essentially this will allow the triggers
4:24,to dynamically increase or decrease the
4:26,tension based on gameplay
4:28,which means the trigger will get tighter
4:29,as you're pulling a bowstring in the
4:31,game
4:31,or as you attempt to drive a car through
4:33,tough rocky terrain
4:35,it's one of the many ways games can
4:36,potentially become more immersive
4:38,so let's hope to see some interesting
4:40,applications for it in the near future
4:44,haptic feedback haptic feedback is
4:46,another new feature in the dual sense
4:48,that sony have been talking up
4:50,which replaces the traditional rumble
4:51,that dualshock controllers have had for
4:53,years
4:54,instead of just static vibrations that
4:56,may or may not vary in intensity
4:58,the dual sense's haptic feedback is much
5:00,more intricately programmable
5:02,allowing for a larger range of feedback
5:05,so if you're jumping into a pool of
5:06,water or driving a car on an icy road or
5:08,walking through knee deep mud
5:10,you will feel different kinds of
5:11,feedback on your controller
5:14,create button the ps5 is making some
5:17,changes to the dualshock 4 share button
5:19,as well it's now called the create
5:22,button and while sony haven't spent a
5:23,lot of time talking about what that
5:25,change entails
5:26,they have provided some brief details
5:29,they have said that it will enable
5:30,players to create and share gameplay in
5:32,new ways
5:33,what exactly does that mean perhaps
5:36,there will be a built-in photo mode
5:37,functionality on a system level
5:39,perhaps it will tie in with the
5:41,console's leaked activities feature
5:43,either way we are curious to know more
5:47,mike the dual synth also has a built-in
5:50,microphone as opposed to the dualshock
5:52,4 making voice chat that much more
5:54,seamless
5:55,we're curious to see how this will be
5:57,implemented especially given the
5:58,potential for annoying crosstalk and
6:00,background noise being captured by the
6:02,microphone
6:03,but hopefully these are all things that
6:04,sony have thought about
6:06,this is another one of those features
6:07,that sony haven't said an awful lot
6:09,about yet
6:10,so here's hoping we learn more about
6:12,this sooner rather than later
6:15,ui overhaul with every new console
6:18,generation comes brand new
6:20,user interfaces most of the time and so
6:22,too will be the case with the ps5
6:25,we don't know yet what the ps5 ui will
6:27,look like
6:28,or what features it will boast of but
6:30,sony have confirmed that it will be
6:32,completely different than the ps4's user
6:34,interface
6:35,there have been rumors of late about the
6:37,so-called activities feature
6:38,which will allow users to jump into
6:40,specific parts of games directly from
6:42,the home menu
6:43,without having to boot up the game and
6:44,then go through a series of menus
6:46,so there's potential for a lot of
6:48,interesting things with this new ui
6:50,here's hoping we learn more about it
6:52,soon
6:54,backward compatibility backward
6:56,compatibility has been a point of
6:57,contention for playstation for most of
6:59,this generation
7:00,especially with their direct competitors
7:01,microsoft making strides in that area
7:04,and while the ps5 isn't going to go all
7:06,in in the way that the xbox series x
7:08,will be doing
7:09,the ps5 will still have backward
7:11,compatibility with the ps4
7:13,sony have said that the vast majority of
7:15,the ps4's library will be playable on
7:17,ps5 at launch
7:18,while more games will be presumably
7:20,added later on as well
7:23,fan noise all ps4 owners understand the
7:27,pain of having a console that sounds
7:28,like a jet engine moments before takeoff
7:31,it's an issue that sony have been made
7:32,aware of time and time again
7:34,and it seems they're going to address
7:35,that with the ps5 they have promised
7:38,that with the upcoming console
7:39,it will be much more silent than its
7:41,predecessor and while it remains to be
7:43,seen just how true
7:44,that turns out to be we're definitely
7:45,hoping for marked improvements
7:49,diskless version this console generation
7:51,has seen digital becoming absolutely
7:54,huge with most companies drawing the
7:56,bulk of their revenue from digital sales
7:58,of course physical games and sales
8:00,aren't going away anytime soon
8:02,but with digital now being an equally
8:04,viable option
8:05,sony are launching a diskless version of
8:07,the ps5 as well
8:09,that's significant of course because
8:11,there has never been an all-digital
8:12,version of any playstation home
8:14,console and that about does it for this
