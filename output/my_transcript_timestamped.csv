0:00,is that time of year again iPhone season
0:03,let's check out all of the little
0:05,differences and performance differences
0:07,between an iPhone 13 Pro and an iPhone
0:09,14 pro
0:11,[Music]
0:15,welcome everybody to Apple Insider it is
0:19,Andrew here and you have probably heard
0:20,there's a new iPhone on the Block we
0:24,have the new iPhone 14 Series this year
0:27,and I have been testing out all day the
0:29,iPhone 14 pro it is a pretty incredible
0:33,piece of Kit if I do say so myself and
0:36,in this video I'm going to be comparing
0:38,that new iPhone 14 pro to my existing
0:41,iPhone 13 Pro I'm going to walk you
0:44,through all the changes in Hardware as
0:46,well as the performance differences and
0:48,even a camera comparison so stay tuned
0:50,buckle up and let's start comparing
0:52,Apple's iPhone 13 Pro against the brand
0:55,new iPhone 14 pro the iPhone 14 pro and
0:59,iPhone 13 Pro each have a 6.1 inch OLED
1:03,Pro display xdr they look really similar
1:07,they have the same resolution the same
1:09,pixel density all of that so what are
1:11,the differences well of course you've
1:13,heard of the dynamic Island that new
1:15,little pill shaped cut out on the top of
1:17,the display can do all sorts of fun
1:19,stuff like show when you're in an app
1:21,background activities music playing
1:23,navigation voice memo screen recordings
1:25,your airpods connecting charging status
1:27,all sorts of things it can even tie into
1:30,live activities from third-party
1:32,applications at least when iOS 16.1
1:35,begins shipping but there's other
1:37,difference as well besides that really
1:40,cool Dynamic Island other changes
1:42,include new Peak brightness but it can
1:44,get all the way up to 2 000 nits of
1:47,brightness when you are outside I did
1:49,take my iPhone 14 pro outside next to my
1:52,iPhone 13 Pro maxed out the brightness
1:54,manually and there is a significant
1:57,difference between these two devices it
1:59,is much easier to see an iPhone 14 pro
2:02,in the Sun than the iPhone 13 Pro hey
2:05,before we get too far into this I have
2:07,to think of a sponsor for this video and
2:08,one of my all-time favorite case
2:10,manufacturers for years
2:12,Alto also has an entire lineup of
2:16,incredible leather cases for all of
2:19,Apple's latest iPhones all of alto's
2:22,cases use incredibly high quality
2:24,Italian aniline dyed Leathers that fit
2:28,your iPhone like a glove and frankly
2:30,feel like they have better leather
2:32,quality than Apple's own cases some
2:34,cases have built-in pockets on the back
2:37,perfect for storing your cart you can
2:39,store several cards in the back of your
2:41,iPhone case and always have them with
2:43,you without having to worry about a
2:45,detachable wallet or an external wallet
2:48,to bring along for the ride if you'd
2:50,prefer a smooth back case don't worry
2:52,also now supports magsafe a big addition
2:55,over their iPhone 13 cases that did not
2:58,have magsape I am so excited that
3:00,magsafe is now built in it's just one of
3:02,many little touches that stand alto's
3:05,cases apart from the rest I also love
3:07,the metal accents on the side they use
3:10,anodized aluminum buttons the same way
3:12,Apple does with their cases they fit
3:14,your iPhone so well protect all of the
3:17,sides there's a raised edge around the
3:18,camera bump all those cases come in
3:20,several different styles including
3:21,playing back mag save support the pocket
3:24,as well as a lanyard version if you want
3:26,to check out any of these visit alto's
3:28,website is linked Down Below in the
3:29,description thank you again to Alto for
3:32,sponsoring this video another difference
3:34,is the iPhone 14 pro has an always on
3:37,display see I'm going to turn it off and
3:39,you'll still see the time right there on
3:41,the screen if I tap it to wake it up it
3:43,gets brighter it'll dim your display
3:45,automatically when in this kind of
3:46,standby mode and it does so by reducing
3:49,the refresh rate all the way down to one
3:51,Hertz one refresh a second which can
3:53,significantly save battery life of
3:55,course it can go up to 120 hertz just
3:57,like with the iPhone 13 Pro that Pro
4:00,motion display that can ramp up and down
4:02,intelligently based on whatever it is
4:04,that you're doing some people have
4:06,posited that the iPhone 14 Pros display
4:08,that's always on is a little two on but
4:11,personally I like it I think it's just
4:13,the amount the right amount of
4:15,brightness you can see your widgets at
4:17,all time you can see your custom
4:18,backgrounds I very much like the new
4:20,always on display but if you're not a
4:22,fan you still can go into settings and
4:23,turn it off the bodies of the two phones
4:25,are pretty similar there's not a big
4:27,difference in changes here except for
4:29,the fact that the iPhone 14 pro has an
4:31,even larger camera bump yeah it's grown
4:33,in size from the iPhone 13 Pro which was
4:35,already a pretty big camera bump but
4:38,everything else the same still as a
4:40,lightning port at the bottom with the
4:41,speaker and the microphones we still
4:43,have the same buttons on the side though
4:44,Apple did remove the SIM card tray and
4:46,is now e-sim only at least here in the
4:48,US Apple says they've improved the
4:50,thermal design of an iPhone 14 pro it's
4:52,a little bit hard to test but it should
4:54,run a little bit cooler especially for
4:55,strenuous tasks like playing games
4:57,editing videos or running a whole bunch
4:59,of Benchmark videos both devices support
5:01,5G but the iPhone 14 pro has some new
5:04,capabilities it also supports Bluetooth
5:06,5.3 and has Satellite Communication
5:09,that'll be coming later this year
5:11,allowing you to get help when you need
5:13,it most and you're out of cellular range
5:15,inside of the iPhone 14 pro is Apple's
5:18,newest a16 bionic processor it's more
5:21,capable than the a15 bionic processor
5:24,that's still in the basic iPhone 14 and
5:26,iPhone 14 plus but how's it score in
5:29,benchmarks booting up geekbench 5. we
5:32,got an 1880 on the single core in a 5317
5:35,on the multi-core on the new iPhone 14
5:37,pro the iPhone 13 Pro in comparison got
5:40,a 1723 and a 4658 a definite Improvement
5:44,for that multi-core score on the
5:46,geekbench 5 graphics test we also saw
5:48,similar improvements on the a16 bionic
5:51,the iPhone 14 pro scored a 15 379 which
5:55,is nearly 8 000 more points than the 14
5:57,401 metal score on the iPhone 13 Pro the
6:01,last Benchmark that I won to test in
6:03,this video was The antutu Benchmark that
6:05,runs through a whole Suite of different
6:07,tests to give you one cumulative score
6:09,the iPhone 14 did fantastic here with
6:12,with a massive increase iPhone 13 Pro
6:15,scored a 767
6:17,863 whereas the iPhone 14 pro scored in
6:21,897 708 the CPU score wasn't all that
6:25,different but the memory graphics and ux
6:28,tests all did significantly better on an
6:31,iPhone 14 pro
6:32,using it day to day so far has not been
6:34,a ton of difference they're still both
6:36,very Speedy devices and I don't think
6:38,you're going to notice a huge difference
6:39,between an iPhone 14 pro and iPhone 13
6:42,Pro and your typical day-to-day tasks so
6:44,what about the cameras this is another
6:46,big upgrade for the iPhone 14 pro series
6:48,Apple has really upgraded pretty much
6:51,all of the cameras on the iPhone 14 pro
6:53,in different ways for starting out with
6:56,a wide angle lens that's the biggest
6:58,jump Apple moved from a 12 megapixel
7:00,sensor to a 48 megapixel sensor now you
7:03,can shoot 48 megapixels in raw mode but
7:06,typically you're still going to get 12
7:08,megapixel photos it's just going to
7:10,combine using pixel binning 4 pixels
7:12,into one super megapixel this should
7:15,drastically improve low light
7:16,Photography in my early test I
7:18,definitely saw an improvement though it
7:20,wasn't a substantial one most people are
7:22,still going to benefit from learning how
7:24,to take better photos than just jumping
7:26,onto the latest iPhone and thinking that
7:28,everything is going to be miraculously
7:29,massively better that said it still
7:32,definitely helped the photos do look
7:34,better low light photography is better
7:36,and it just seems like it's faster to
7:37,focus in those low light situations and
7:40,overall I've seen a bit less noise
7:41,another benefit is that you can now
7:43,shoot at two time zoom without any loss
7:46,of quality you get to use that wide
7:48,angle lens for two times Zoom because
7:51,it's now 48 megapixels to still get a 12
7:53,megapixel photo you're essentially
7:55,getting all the benefits of that wide
7:57,angle sensor than the telephoto lens
7:59,which is still kept at three times of
8:02,optical zoom so now you have 0.5 for
8:04,your Ultra wide you have one for your
8:06,standard wide Lens two times optical
8:09,zoom for your wide lens and three times
8:11,optical zoom for your telephoto lens I
8:14,think people are really going to like
8:15,having that two times optical zoom
8:17,without any loss of quality compared to
8:19,having to switch to the telephoto lens
8:21,which just isn't always as good as that
8:24,standard wide lens one of my favorite
8:26,new features of the iPhone 14 pro though
8:28,is the improvements of cinematic mode I
8:30,took Mosby out into the yard and started
8:32,shooting some some cinematic mode videos
8:34,and there's a big difference over how
8:36,they look with an iPhone 13 Pro Apple
8:38,has been improving cinematic mode for
8:40,some time on the iPhone 13 Pro but it's
8:43,much better on an iPhone 14 pro because
8:45,you can now shoot in 4K resolution as
8:47,well as 24 or 30 frames per second at
8:50,that resolution it's amazing and it
8:52,makes a big difference when shooting
8:53,video it doesn't look as grainy or uh as
8:57,low resolution on a larger display
8:59,because before you can only shoot at
9:01,1080. now you can shoot in 4k it looks
9:04,so much better just look at the sample
9:06,video of Mosby playing with this ball in
9:08,the yard it looks so much better than it
9:10,did on an iPhone 13 Pro there are a
9:13,couple other minor differences between
9:14,an iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 14 pro
9:17,there's a new color available this new
9:19,bright purple color and the blue has
9:22,gone away it's nice but you still don't
9:24,notice it all that much it's not a
9:25,vibrant Hue of purple like it would be
9:27,for an iPhone 14 based model that has
9:30,some brighter colors it's still very
9:32,much a darker grayish with kind of a
9:35,purple hint going on it's not nearly as
9:37,vibrant as I'm sure some people want
9:40,Apple also increased the battery life by
9:42,a bit another hour or two depending on
9:44,what you're doing I'll always take more
9:46,battery life even if it isn't a massive
9:48,deal more than the prior generation
9:50,another neat feature is the iPhone 14
9:52,pro has crash detection which can help
9:54,save your life in an accident and this
9:56,is also featured on the latest version
9:58,of the Apple watch that pretty much sums
10:00,it up I think there are a couple of game
10:02,changing features coming to the iPhone
10:03,14 pro to make it feel a bit more newer
10:05,and fresher than years past the new
10:08,always on display and dynamic Island are
10:11,incredible to use and make a big
10:13,difference actually when you're using
10:15,the phone the camera is also a really
10:17,nice upgrade especially that 48
10:19,megapixel wide angle sensor it is very
10:22,nice and indefinite improvements for low
10:24,light photography if you're a huge
10:26,iPhone user it might be worth the
10:28,upgrade what do you guys think let me
10:30,know the differences Down Below in the
10:31,comments or on Twitter at Android your
10:32,underscore OSU if you'd like to grab
10:34,iPhone 14 pro there's some links and
